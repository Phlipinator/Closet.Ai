I would like an inch or a little less of extra length, but most of the time, I expect these to stay tucked in.

When reading reviews I found it helpful when others provided actual weight and height.  The product was bought for a slender teen about 116 pounds and 5ft 8in. The M worked perfect for the way he likes clothing to fit. We followed the washing instructions and have washed them twice and dried in the dryer on the air dry cycle for delicate clothing. They held their shape and color. The lighting is terrible in the pictures so it doesn’t do the shirt justice. Super soft, very comfortable, tag-less is a plus, and length is phenomenal. They are thin but these colors were only see through if you held them up to a light source. My teen does not like the fitted look so we bought the medium. If you are looking for a well fitted shirt get your actual size based off the size guide. Based off these last comments, the item did not get a 5 star review.

Good thick fabric, 100% cotton (but low thread count feel), will shrink, NOT tagless but tag rips off easily.For this price point, there is no point in complaining as if you paid more so here are some things to expect:It’s 100% cotton so it’s going to shrink since it’s not “pre-shrunk”It’s possible these are “fake” as many claim, or it may be Hanes cutting back on quality control. There is no way to knowing one way or another but here are some observations.Got 3 packs and 1 shirt had a hole in the back already.Shirts will NOT arrive in Factory branded bags, they’ll be in generic sealed plastic bags (my guess is because its easier for “try before you buy returns” to be folded/packaged/resealed for the next buyer) so wash before wearing.This is NOT tagless, but the tag does tear off easily. This doesn’t PROVE these are fake of knock offs (Maybe Hanes has a large stockpile of tags they can sew on for the cost of nothing instead of spending on the special ink, running the machinery and employees trained to operate said machinery to get that tagless. Idk.These are most likely 100% cotton as claimed so they WILL shrink! I find the larger the shirt size the more they will shrink relative to their size. So plan accordingly.A common complaint is that they’re itchy. All I can say is WASH BEFORE WEARING as you should be anyways. Ever heard of demodex mites? Now you have.Another complaint is that they feel rough. this isn’t 3000 thread count Egyptian cotton feeling more like 300 thread count. With that said these are FAR thicker than the genuine Hanes shirts I’ve bought in store in the last few years. Personally, I’ve never noticed.Bottom line: If you are the type of guy who may not even own a pair of cargo pants (anymore) but loved them because of its functionality. Who knows what SAE/metric is, and doesn’t wear tight jeans (by choice).Chances are very high you’ll be happy with these.$2.50/shirt + tax', ""These shirts are a great deal for a four pack. I only wished there was a way where you could pick four different colors instead of the same color for all four shirts. Please keep in mind, these shirts are 100% cotton and they do shrink a little. So if you're in-between sizes, I would suggest to size up a little. I bought a size which I knew would be slightly larger for me and after I washed and dried the shirts, they were perfect size because they shrunk about 1.5 inches from the sides and from the bottom.

I cant stand when shirt sleeves start rising up. These are slightly thinner than the FL Tshirts however they come close. I did a wash to be sure and they still stand up as a non undershirt to wear out.  Sleeves didnt rise and the XL fit nicely (IM 6,1 & 195).  I personally dont like shirts extremely soft.

If youre looking for the FL Plain tshirt feel like I was get these.', ""I've been wearing Gildan undershirts for almost 20 years, these are probably the best version I've ever purchased. Why...?1) Not tagless, but tags removed easily w/simple tear2) Heavier duty, but NOT too heavy [I sweat so I need ones that soak it up preventing it from showing to top layer + not as thick as the HEAVY version which can be too much]. The thickness also provides a better form fit under your top layers [not sticking to those unflattering curves for us non-super models] and helps to create a sold shapely base for the top layers.3] Still TBA but so far I believe these will hold up longer than versions advertised as undershirts which are so thin the stain easy, wrinkle, and provide no shape. The thinner version sinks into cracks and crevasses typically taking the top layers with it creating an unflattering look.4] Sleeves stay in place [as undershirt, as opposed to the thinner ones that constantly roll up under your top layers, ultimately [at least for me] requiring constant readjustment.5] Looking forward to confirming but I've been finding the thinner version advertised as undershirts typically require replacement [bleach won't return them to white once pit stains wear in which eventually start show through when wearing thinner or light colored top layers], the overall feel and quality of this version have me anticipating a much longer shelf life [and I'm one who wears them daily under all wardrobe combinations.6] They're GILDAN, and as brand loyal customer, I can say hands down I've never find a more reasonably priced brand that delivers quality like Gildan does!!! While staying affordable [Walmart used to carry them but those idiots no longer do so Amazon typically offers the best pricing.I've only had this batch about a week now, should they not meet expectations, I will return to update this feedback with explanations and findings.Hope my review helps you determine if this version is right for you!!!"", 'I was surprised how heavy the material was but when used under my dress white shirts they’re perfect.

t-shirt,"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/319KoqtBeFL._AC_SR160,200_.jpg","['I needed some cheap black tees and this fit the bill. I am overall impressed with what I got for the money. The one thing I dont like about them is they collect a lot of lint/fuzzies from other clothes.', ""Awesome!!!  Here is how I buy clothes.1. I like low cost. a. Amazon is low cost.  And I don't have to drive 50 miles to the Outlet store.2. I buy the same clothes over and over.  Always the same sizes and colors for the basic items. a. I buy Champion long boxer briefs, preferably made in Vietnam. b. I buy sock from Johnston and Murphy. c. I buy t-Shirts (and most other items) from Brooks Brothers Outlet.Unfortunately, Johnston and Murphy's over the calf blue merino wool socks change over the year.  Double pipes at first, then single pipes close together, then triple pipes.  All I want is the same exact blue sock and same exact grey sock year after year so that I can avoid matching socks out of the clean clothes basket.  No, what should be the same exact sock is a big mix and match event every morning.  Same thing with Champion.  Why do I have to check to see what country they are made in before buying them.  Why can't I just trust that Champion underwear are the same the world over.3. I like high quality.  Here is how I define quality: a. Don't skimp on material. b. Long staple threads. c. Ergonomically cut.Every single sock manufacturer out there is skimping on material on socks.  Johnston and Murphy, Brooks Brothers, all shorter as the years go by.  They make them a quarter of an inch shorter.  It doesn't sound like a lot.  But I have to keep pulling up my new socks.  I never have to pull up my old socks.  How much money is being saved by cutting the socks a quarter inch shorter?Brooks Brothers t-shirts are still pretty good.  I have stuck with Brooks Brothers because every other t-shirt manufacturer that I've tried makes them an inch shorter, which means they come untucked.  Brooks Brothers t-shirts always stay tucked in.  And they don't pill after 10 washes.  I hate pilled t-shirts.  I hate them!Ergonomically cut: my mother bought me some gold toe socks.  I have big calves.  The elastic cut into my calves by the end of the day.  Five year old Johnston and Murphy socks are butter smooth.  The new ones are starting to cut with a sharp rigid thread around the top.  Brooks Brothers has a nice soft elastic at the top--if you buy the non-outlet variety--which go for $25 - $50 per pair.  That's a lot of money for socks when I like to keep 15 pair of blue and 15 pair of grey in the drawer after a full wash.  That would be like $750 - $1,500 for socks.  But the ergonomics on a sock make the difference between a beautiful day and a day that makes you feel like you've been sweating out in the sun.So, here is the scoop on the Amazon Essentials t-Shirts:1. Value: They are $16 for 6 shirt.  So, that's about $32 per year that I would spend on t-shirts.  That's Awesome!2. Consistency: Amazon gets it!  They actually advertises that they are not going to keep switching up.  You get the same thing every time.  I'm sure they will find a better way to make something and that a change will occur every now and then.  That's fine if they make an improvement.  But I'm betting it will not be changing the number of pipes running down my socks.  I'm sure other brands change the number of pipes because they found a factory in one country that makes they cheaper than in another country.  And they are not made to Johnston and Murphy's specs.  They are just  socks already being produced by another manufacturer at a lower cost than the last factory.3. Ergonomics: The t-shirts fit well.  From what I can tell so far, Amazon Essentials t-shirts use long staple cotton that will not pill.But all of this is really to communicate to Amazon.  Nice job with Amazon Essentials!  Would you *please* make some over-the-calf dress socks.  I will love you even more than I already do.  Please consider making long inseam boxer briefs that somehow keep the legs from riding up or don't start slipping down.  Also, I wear a lot of all cotton, non-iron dress shirts.  All cotton, non-iron, pleated, chino's would be awesome.  Long rise, gaberdine dress slacks would be great!  But, maybe I'm getting beyond the essentials with the slacks.  But please, the socks!  I hate every reasonable priced sock, that I've tried, that is made today."", 'Some reviews mention that this t shirt is too thin. I found it to be perfect for an undershirt.

Feel great, not too thin.', ""I had originally gotten a 5 pack of grey and black in size Medium. First of all, for reference, I'm tall and skinny but have pretty wide shoulders. The length is perfect for me - it's long enough to actually stay tucked in and the length didn't drastically shrink in the wash unlike most other undershirts I've worn. The width is narrow/tight which is great for me around the waist and chest since most other undershirts are a bit to wide, but the shoulders were uncomfortably tight. Even as someone who is used to dealing with shirts with narrower shoulders, it was surprisingly too tight and uncomfortable. So I ordered the same pack again but with a size Large this time. Now they are much more roomy and comfortable around the shoulders, although maybe a little too baggy/wide. And of course the length is hilariously long since the Mediums were already long enough, but since I always tuck them anyway in I don't mind. I'm still glad I switched to the Large and will probably keep wearing them since it's hard for me to find grey undershirts that are long enough to stay tucked in. So I would recommend ordering a size up if you can't stand really tight shoulders.Another thing to note is that all the shirts smelled pretty bad at first (again, I got the grey and black ones so I'm not sure if the other colors smell too). I'm guessing it's from Formaldehyde or something. I didn't always notice the smell right away for some reason, but it's definitely noticeable after the shirts are sitting there a while or you sniff closely. And none of my other clothes smell like that so I know it's not coming from anything else. However, after washing them several times in a row and adding a cup of white vinegar in the washer with them, the smell has pretty much gone away, so in the long run I don't think it's a big deal. Just be aware that you may have to wash them multiple times for the smell to fade away.One more issue is that the number of each color pictured in the pack is not necessarily what you will get. The black/grey 5 pack I ordered had 3 grey and 2 black shirts for my first order of size Medium, which is what was shown in the picture and is what I wanted. However, when I ordered the same pack but with a size Large, I got 2 grey and 3 black instead. It's not a huge deal to me and not worth returning given the cheap price, but I was slightly disappointed because I mainly just want the grey shirts. So keep in mind that the picture might not match exactly what you will get.""]"

Unfortunately, without print or anything it's hard to quickly tell which side is the front vs. the back. So throwing this on in the morning before a workout makes you stop and think or try it on twice if it doesn't feel right. Overall a small snag but still an inconvenience.

These aren’t quite as popular but they should be, they are better made and about the same price per shirt if you buy the multipacks with five shirts in them. And the biggest thing they have going for them is the incredible choice of colors, although I would suggest to them that they should try to stay away from including so many of the dull dark colors, today’s active man doesn’t dress like his grandfather, bright colors are very popular now.The material isn’t like most casual tee shirts, it is a shiny slick manmade material that on close inspection looks like it is knit like a very thin sweater.WHAT I LIKETopping the list of likes are the great bright colors that stay bright wash after wash. They don’t shrink either and they are true to U.S. men’s sizes.  That makes them easy to buy.  They feel great and don’t show wrinkles.NOT SO POSITIVEThere is nothing that I dislike about these but there are a few things you should know. One is that they are fairly thin. That coupled with the shiny texture makes them reveal everything including the nips. They also look too expensive and dressy to wear casually around the house, like mowing the lawn for example. Like I said, not a negative just something to be aware of. If you live in a hot climate as I do these are absolutely wonderfully cool and lightweight feeling.YES OR NOAfter getting ready to order my usual brand and being disappointed that their shades are so boring I searched and was amazed how many choices there were.

These are one of the best values around.', ""I was drawn to these because they are inexpensive and I wanted something plain for the gym.

Comfy, and i like how they have no tag.', ""The quality and feel of the shirts is great, but they have one drawback which may bother some people (and certainly bothers me quite a lot). There is no tag or print on the inside back neckline of the shirt where you could easily see if it's the front or back, and the collar of the shirt is as such that front and back looks almost identical when you're holding it, and so oftentimes I end up putting it on backwards, have to take it back off, and put it on the right way. They really should have either made a tag on the back neckline of the shirt or some printing on it, as most shirts have. This wouldn't have been an issue as much with a v-neck shirt, but with this one it can get quite frustrating. Aside from that, it's a great shirt.""]"

Used Downy wrinkle release spray on it after the laundry not getting rid of the odor since it also contains odor neutralizer components, and let it air out for another 2 days - finally, the odor was gone.  Best way to describe the odor was like a chemical version of extremely bad BO.  I own many UA clothing, including other compression shirts and never had that chemical smell in any other than 1 which aired out and lost the odor in a day.Had also purchased another UA compression shirt at the same time as this one (different model, not the same neck cut) - it has a different thickness and feel to it and didn't have an odor upon arrival.  Both feel great, but prefer the comfort and fit of this one over the other and even over any of my other UA and other branded compression shirts.*Synopsis:- Shirt arrived with a bad chemical odor.Solution:  Wash with laundry (it may still have the smell after washing), then use *Downy Wrinkle Release Spray* (also includes odor neutralizing ingredients) and air it out for a day.  Using the spray after the wash worked perfectly and eliminated the odor 100%.- It fits great and feels extremely comfortable!"", 'I\'ve tried S, M, LG, and X-LG in an attempt to make this shirt work for me, without success. It might, however work for you.I\'m a fairly exothermic guy and always prefer these sorts of shirts to baggier t-shirts, buttons downs, pull-overs and the like. I always go for heat gear because unless I am going to be standing around in sub-15F temperatures, anything heavier just makes me too hot.I also wear these shirts everywhere - to work, to bed, around the house, out hiking, out to restaurants, everywhere, so I can\'t have anything that is too formfitting. I\'m in very good shape, but if feels obnoxious wandering around in something that fits like a second skin. That and it is just uncomfortable for me.What I wanted was something like I currently have - a lightweight, fitted synthetic shirt  that is well-made with no or minimally visible logos. Nothing baggy. Nothing skin-tight. These seemed like a perfect match - UA is a good brand, these have no logos at all, and while they are compression shirts I figured I would just buy up one size.Turns out this doesn\'t really work. These shirts are intended to be compression shirts, which means they only really work (move with the body and offload heat) when they are compressing the skin. The material is actually fairly thick before it is stretched out. Buying up a size resulted in a shirt that just ill-fitting, having extra material all over the place and still being too hot, since now the air couldn\'t circulate properly through the material. That said, this issue aside the material is quite comfortable against the skin and seems to be high quality.Fit-wise: I am a 5\'10"" male with an athletic build, ~185 with a <10% BMI. So very fit, but not ""swole"" in any way. I tried the small, medium, large, and extra large. S was way too tight - getting it off was tougher than getting it on and getting it on wasn\'t exactly a picnic. M was pretty good, but since I didn\'t want something form-fitting, I tried L and XL. The L had the general look I wanted, whereas the XL, while still being surprisingly tight, had way too much extra material. However, even the L was too hot during normal day-to-day activities, let alone while running or working outside. The M, L, and XL were all heavier by about 20% than my current shirts (black Reebocks, which I would buy again but the model is discontinued).So if you want compression and something skin-tight, my recommendation for someone my size is M or, if you have more muscle mass up top, maybe a LG. If you don\'t want compression, try a different shirt instead.EDIT: Worth noting that after a few washes, the shirts loosen up considerably. Enough that the XL is now a little baggy around the waist for me (for a compression shirt, anyway). As such, the L is probably the better way to go, once it is broken it, it should fit nicely.', ""I got these at a really great deal.  They were purchased mainly to make wearing my vest more comfortable.  They feel great and almost forget they are there.  Im normally a xl bit got an l for added compression.  Just be aware that these try before you buy items may show signs of use.  I washed the two last ones I got and forgot to take pictures of the deodorant streaks it came with before it was washed.  But I did post the picture of a torn bag sealed inside the resealed package I received.  This shouldn't stop you from purchasing this shirt.  It allows me to stay comfortable under kevlar and another shirt.""]"

I’m pregnant, and by about 23 weeks, my belly has gotten too large for my normal shirts in size S, and was threatening to get too big for size M soon. Due to my height, though, women’s and maternity PJs weren’t fitting right, either. So I ordered these in a L and XL to try on.The large is a much better fit for me, but it still has enough room that I think I’ll be able to wear it until my due date comfortably. Like other reviewers said, it’s really comfortable - not too thick or too thin. It’s a good weight for summer without feeling cheap or flimsy. It’s so soft that I’m surprised it’s 100% cotton, and it has held up well through a few rounds of machine washing and drying. I will definitely buy more of these, either in size L to accommodate my baby bump, or in S/M for after I lose the baby weight.Just be aware that because it’s so soft, it does nothing at all to hide your nips. My husband loved how the XL felt, but vetoed it as soon as he looked at himself in the mirror (I assume an undershirt would fix this, but then it kind of defeats the purpose of buying a soft, comfy tee).

Here is my synopsis...The good:  I wear an XXL in most shirts (6’3 -250 lbs, broad shoulders, a little extra fluff in the midsection).  I like my shirts to hang below the waist for comfort and it is appropriately long enough for most circumstances (see caveat in the ‘bad‘ section).  Sizes tend to vary in Amazon branded clothing and I am fortunate this one fits like other XXL standard fit shirts.  The color and pattern are also very attractive and add nice personality to my otherwise bland wardrobe.  The material is also soft so this shirt is comfortable to wear.The bad:  I question the longevity of this material and it seem like it will show wear and/or come apart at the seams.  Don’t expect this to be a forever shirt.  The material also wrinkles very easily and will be a hot mess when it comes out of the washer.  Take it out of the wash right away and smooth out the wrinkles before hanging or putting in the dryer to avoid excessive ironing.  As for the caveat of sizing, it’s not long enough for those who carry a concealed firearm in a belt holster, legally of course.  You’ll probably want one of the tall sizes for that.Overall this is a good, but not great shirt.  It is attractive, soft, and fits like most other shirts in the same size.  Material quality is questionable and when washed, it will wrinkle like a 90 year old man who has been in the bathtub for an hour.', 'I am repeating this review for all three shirts I bought for myself as they are listed on the website in different groups: I learned at an early age to look for things that indicate a product is well made.

All of the shirts match very well on all of the areas that should. The pockets are a perfect match. The only negative I have is that I would prefer either pre-shrunk fabric or a small amount of polyester, so that shirts don\'t shrink. At 6\'4"", I have no room for the shirt length or the sleeves to shrink. I will never be able to put these in the dryer b/c they are 100% cotton that says nothing about being preshrunk. I like the shirts well enough to put up with that, but I do wish that all companies would think about shrinkage when using cotton. It feels great, but it should never be used without pre-shrinking the material. One other note, the range for rating the length is confusing. I chose these shirts b/c they work well for untucked fashion. They can also be tucked in, so they will work either way.', ""Our church did a prank on our husbands and the men all ended up wearing the same shirt without having a clue!

I love that this has longer sleeves and just right torso length, a little two wide in shoulders but like it said it’s advertised for men so that’s probably a perfect design if purchased for a male or a female who is harder at the shoulders. The quality of material also exceeds my expectations. It pilled a little after first wash but still fine, didn’t seem to shrink much if any. Would recommend trying. I do think I’ll purchase again.

There is no way to knowing one way or another but here are some observations.Got 3 packs and 1 shirt had a hole in the back already.Shirts will NOT arrive in Factory branded bags, they’ll be in generic sealed plastic bags (my guess is because its easier for “try before you buy returns” to be folded/packaged/resealed for the next buyer) so wash before wearing.This is NOT tagless, but the tag does tear off easily. This doesn’t PROVE these are fake of knock offs (Maybe Hanes has a large stockpile of tags they can sew on for the cost of nothing instead of spending on the special ink, running the machinery and employees trained to operate said machinery to get that tagless. Idk.These are most likely 100% cotton as claimed so they WILL shrink! I find the larger the shirt size the more they will shrink relative to their size. So plan accordingly.A common complaint is that they’re itchy. All I can say is WASH BEFORE WEARING as you should be anyways. Ever heard of demodex mites? Now you have.Another complaint is that they feel rough. this isn’t 3000 thread count Egyptian cotton feeling more like 300 thread count.

Personally, I’ve never noticed.Bottom line: If you are the type of guy who may not even own a pair of cargo pants (anymore) but loved them because of its functionality.

Because of the material and it being black, it’s not good if you have a dog.', 'This is my husband\'s 10th Calvin Klein Slim Fit shirt, and that should say it all! We tried various brands before landing on this CK slim fit shirt as the go-to one. Husband was looking for a slim fit with no pockets, spread collar, comfortable good fit, little wrinkling, and non-see through. This Sandstone shirt does all of those things.Because it\'s flexible all over including under arms and neck, the shirt is comfortable to wear. It has a good fit all over and the slim flit is flattering on him (he has muscular back, arms and shoulders and the shirt follows the contours of his body but doesn\'t cling to it - it\'s not extra-slim.) It is just the right length to be tucked in (he\'s of average height).We got this shirt to replace a Kenneth Cole Reaction shirt that is almost identical in style and color but I swear the KC shirt would wrinkle just by looking at it. I actually liked the fact that the Kenneth Cole didn\'t have a yoke (a separate piece of fabric sewn in across the shoulders and upper back), but instead had non-noticeable 3"" darts on each shoulder. But we just couldn\'t get past the terrible wrinkling of that shirt. The CK shirt having the yoke makes it look a bit more formal / dressy but it\'s ok.As far as wrinkles with the Calvin Klein slim fit (cause it was a dealbreaker for other brands): The Calvin Klein irons up easily, surprisingly for a 100% cotton shirt. If you don\'t sweat, you can wear it a few times before washing without it looking like you did just that. (If you sweat, don\'t rewear - please, for the love of all that is good!)This shirt has not shrunk in the wash.  Even though the label says no ironing, I air dry these shirts and then touch them up with a quick 90 second ironing. Packaging on this shirt varies. It could come in a bubble mailer or in a box. This particular shirt came stuffed into a too-small box but you\'d never know - the same quick iron as usual and it was all better.This shirt comes in a bunch of different colors and you can\'t see through the non-white ones (the white is see-thru, not recommended by me - I\'d look elsewhere if you\'re searching for a thick white shirt).I\'ve included a close-up of the cool herringbone fabric weave. Many colors of this shirt have a really nice sheen to them; the shirt changes colors a bit by looking at it from different angles. This Sandstone shirt doesn\'t have the sheen that many others in the collection do. I\'ve included a picture of the Purple Dusk color so you can see the nice sheen.The buttons on the CK Slim fit shirts are nice (bit of shiny mother of pearl look to them instead of standard white buttons). The collar stays are your standard flexible plastic. They hold in the shirt reasonably well. Have just lost 2 or 3 over the years.I will continue to buy this model of shirt in other colors. I recommend checking the price over time though because these shirts can wildly fluctuate in price on Amazon.', '!Great product. fits well']"

I had gotten a quite variety of colors and designs for him. He loves them because they are really cool literally. He used to like more Under Armour , another brand but the price difference is almost 25% more for this other brand. The Columbia's shirts are really lightweight so keeping them in the lugagge is very convenient. I am comparing 2 kind of similar shirts, I saw another person who did it this way and is really efficient for buyers doing it this way.Slack Tide Camp shirts are made with the same material as Tamiami ii they both are really lightweight, they are sold as fishing shirts that I am sure are very fit for this but my husband has used them as a regular work office/field shirt. These shirts share the same design in the back but the thing I like the most is that Slack Tide's at the very bottom have a straight line so using them without tucking them inside the pants looks really nice. Tamiami ii has the classic extra lenght in front and back so using them outside the pants does not looks as cool specially if you used them for work. I believe for young guys this would not matter too much. Continuing with my descrption for Slack Tide's they have only one rather small pocket with no velcro, buttons etc. They do not have the traditional velcro base Columbia's logo in the front but a small tag on the pocket with the Columbia logo. This kind of shirts have a small loop/snare at the top button is not the traditional top button of all other shirts, still looking nice. Slack Tide shirts have, and is a very small detail but lovely, Located at the the front lower part these shirts has a small piece of fabric that according to Columbia' s decription its function is to clean one's sun glasses or just your regular reading lenses. This is very nice. This shirt is more fit than Tamiami ii. Size: important for many readers: the lenght is the SAME in both shirts but the size at the shoulders and middle area is BIGGER in the Tamiami ii. The buttons that Slack tide comes with have 2 colors with a predominat color matching the shirt's color. In contrast Tamiami ii has all them buttoms matching the color of the shirt. The neck collar on Slack Tide's has no buttons, in contrast Tamiami ii comes with buttons making it more straight. The colors are the same is not possible to get Slack Tide's in white for that reason I End up buying this Tamiami ii to complement his collection.Tamiami ii shirts are less formal, same materials, same coolness level in very hot situations. White or light color are somewhat translucid so it is advisable to use a t shirt underneath to avoid too much nipple exposee. The very nice thing of this shirt is the multiple pockets 2 of them been large and secure, help one to keep things and avoid loosing things. They both shirts comes with a mesh inside that help the transpiration process, or just simply drying faster after some rain, ocean mist etc. Because the material is poliester is not recommendable for any of these shirts either Slack Tide nor Tamiami ii to be around bushes or even close to non polished surfaces because they tend to tread easily. So I believe this is the reason for what they designed for fishermans. Tamiami ii quality is not as good as Slack Tide, besides that both are well done Prices are similar if not identical in both kind of shirts. I definitely recommend to buy them, I would keep buying them in the future but just to wrapp this up and finish my review my favorite one is Slack Tide Camp shirts. I hope this review will be usefull.""]"

I would only believe this to be true if you wear your pants lower then normal for dress slacks. If pants are worn at the waist the tail is just fine. I happen to be 6\'1 194lbs.The shirt is not see through, however if you have tattoos like I do, you can make them out slightly theough the material. That being said for a dress shirt this is pretty normal. It is not a solid white button down.Sleeves fit perfectly although my arms and are true to size. I hated wearing a vest and having shirts arm sleeves appear overly baggy. This shirt fits the bill and most certainly has a narrower then usual shirts.The waist is a little looser then I would have liked. My waist is 34"". However if you are wearing a vest it solves this problem. You can definitely have a slight belly and get away with this shirt.I have yet to wash this shirt and it is 100% cotton so I am slightly worried about sizing once its washed. I will comment further after the wash.Otherwise I am very happy with this shirt. The collar is beautiful and brings a more contemporary style in my opinion then standard. Like all clothes some will fit others better. My advice is to get measured professionally before making the purchase. Once you are certain of your size, as long as you purchase correctly you should be happy with this product.Price is about in line for what you get here.

I had to attend a function where I needed to wear a white shirt so I ordered this in white.  I already own the same shirt in several darker colors, but I was disappointed to discover how see-through the white version is.  Chest hair and body hair show clearly through this shirt.  Nipples show through as well, in great detail - perhaps not a big deal for guys, but do you really want people distracted by your nipples?  Basically, the white version of this shirt is unwearable without an undershirt.  I suspect you could probably get away with this level of transparency on a loose fitting shirt, but the Xtreme Slim Fit is cut close to the skin for a more tailored look.  Unfortunately, even wearing an undershirt is not a perfect solution, because you can clearly see the undershirt right through this shirt, especially the collar and sleeves of the undershirt, and if you wear a short-sleeve undershirt, your arm hair will still show through.  In summary, I recommend this shirt in any of the darker colors, but I do not recommend this Xtreme Slim Fit shirt in white, due to its Xtreme see-through nature.""]"

The size charts indicated that it should fit a 35"" sleeve which is what he needs, so I went ahead and gave the shirt a try. I ordered a large and chose the slim fit over the regular because he generally wears slim dress shirts.  When I pulled the shirt out of the package I was already regretting my purchase. The fabric and the colors looked cheap and the construction seemed more like a discount store shirt than something of better quality. I went ahead and had my husband try it on for sizing. It was a pretty skimpy cut through the shoulders and arms, and the sleeves weren\'t quite long enough. If I\'d liked the shirt we could have sized up to an XL and gotten an OK fit, but I just didn\'t like the look of the shirt.

In recent years I’ve had to suffice with the 34/35 sleeve length thing (they say the second button on cuff provides for the 34” vs the 35”).With these shirts they use the lettering system of S, R and L (I think) for sizing the sleeve length. Historically the S (short) is 32/33”, the R (regular) is 34/35” and the L (long) would be 36/37”.  So, when I order a 16.5R, I’d expect to see a 34/35” sleeve but what came today are 16.5 32/33. How can one part of the item say a simply an R…then you get a numbered sleeve…and that numbered sleeve is not what is traditionally as R length??

I wore one everyday of the winter, as did my partner.  All have been washed at least 12 times.Folks saying theirs shrunk don’t know how to wash lambs wool, so I will offer some assistance:-wash in COLD-GENTLE cycle or HAND wash-wool appropriate detergent-NO FABRIC SOFTENER-DO NOT SPIN!!!  JUST DON’T DO IT.  NO NO NO NO NO SPIN.Drain the water, but NO SPIN.It is the high speed spin cycle that is shrinking the fibers.  Lightly roll the excess water out.-NO drying in heat.-shape the cardigan, being sure to shape the pockets and button front and collar.-lay FLAT to dry.  DO NOT HANG.  It will take a day to dry, but the extra care is worth it.The reason folks have shrinkage is because they are not properly handling laundering.  If you skip any of the above, or do things to wool that should not be done, you will have problems.  That’s how wool works.  These ARE machine washable, but you have to know how to use the machine WITH WOOL.Construction:  the sweaters are fabulously sewn with no loose buttons, no loose or messy seams.  The wool is very good, and very solid.  I would expect to pay $100 more that the list price.The colors are very nice, and are as pictured (I have 10 colors).  A color not being what your monitor shows you is a common problem, but that’s has nothing to do with the actual product.  It has to do with your monitor/device.I do not find the wool to be at all itchy, but that’s my skin.  If you have sensitive skin or an aversion to the feel of wool, these are not for you.  No wool is for you.  It doesn’t mean the product is bad in any way, it means wool isn’t for you.The routine of washing:  I use all cotton thick bath mats (clean, of course) and lay the wet sweaters on the mats on a table in my laundry room, and yes, sometimes all around the house.  Don’t use drying racks unless they are completely flat as you want no part of the wet sweater hanging.Owning wool apparel items comes with the knowledge that wool must be handled and laundered differently.  Wool shrinkage is not a product defect, it’s a consumer knowledge deficit.  Know wool before you buy it.  Size up several sizes if you need practice.Bonus:  I’m a small woman, 130 lbs.  I INTENTIONALLY shrank one sweater that I bought in a 2XLT to make it a much thicker, smaller sweater.  The fibers shrank as I intended, I shaped the sweater, and it made the sweater an Antarctic ready thick and wicking sweater/coat.  I wore it to the Bronx Zoo in an all day downpour and the sweater kept me entirely dry, and warm.Get to know your wool, and you will LOVE your wool sweaters, and at such an incredible price!', ""This was Christmas present and he loves it.

Most things Amazon brand I order medium, but modern day cuts I seem to be trending towards large in more than not now. Anyway, there weren\'t much for details as to fit so I went on the safe side and got a large. Figured it\'s purpose of an outer layer suits a roomy fit for layering and while I was right, I was also wrong, because this thing doesn\'t need much else for layers. It\'s super thick, supple and soft fleece is so warm. A long sleeve T is all I need under this thing in our NW winters, which admittedly aren\'t too harsh.  Anyway, I cannot recommend this strongly enough. The length is just right, below the hips so when you bend over it doesn\'t ride up exposing the back, but not below the butt being too long and awkward looking as to require adjustment when you sit down.

I\'m used to Merino wool which is machine-washable, so I didn\'t think to remember ""Oh wait, this is lamb\'s wool, not Merino...""  D\'OH!  The sweater arrives and says to hand wash and lay flat to dry.  So zi hand washed it and let it dry for a few days.Trying it on, it\'s a little tight with a long sleeve shirt underneath.  Maybe I should have gone a size up.  The sleeves were long and I had to fold them back, but that is typical for me, I have short arms.  Otherwise I\'ve noticed that it tends to shed fuzzies easily and has a bit of a smell when wet which means it is likely of lesser quality wool.  Made in China.  Also, a lot of red dye came out in the washing so it looks a little bit duller as it is drying.Overall it fits okay though but I did notice that because it\'s a bit tight, the buttons can look like they are popping until I reach down and stretch the material along the sides.  It would have helped if the buttons were not super close to the edge of the right side of the sweater, as the material on the left side pulls away and creates a space.  I\'d say try to get a size that will not be tight around your middle, or better yet, stick with a zippered sweater unless you really like the buttoned look.UPDATE 12/22/2022:I have been wearing this sweater over another cotton sweater (as well as some wool layers) and I have to say, I am impressed with how warm I am able to stay even in 35+ degree weather.  Have not needed to wear the winter coat unless it gets below 35 degrees or so and is windy.  For that I added another star to my original review.However, I have noticed that there is a fair amount of pilling taking place along the arms (see picture #2).  These fuzzies are easy enough to pull off, just annoying.  Again, that reflects cheaper material.  However, taking into account the price of the sweater, the lightweight material, and overall usefulness, I have decided it is worth a 4 star review after all.']"

The collar has about 2"" of extra material and is loose and baggy.  (Terrible neck fit.)  The general bagginess means it will never be as warm as a snug fit, other than around the shoulders and chest.  The weave is a bit loose compared to a similar North Face garment, and while you don\'t expect a mid layer to block wind, this one will blow right through; any air movement whatsoever will go right through it.  The loose weave and baggy fit might also prevent effective wicking (so is not suited for activity wear), forms air pockets, and won\'t be as warm or comfortable under a shell or insulated jacket as it would be if it were a good fit.  I don\'t think I\'ll wear it for downhill skiing; the baggy collar will never fit properly under a jacket collar or hood, and will either be uncomfortably lumpy or cold, or both.  On the plus side it doesn\'t have any pockets, adjusters, straps, embellishments, vents, or anything else that that will lump up, so is definitely a proper mid layer to go under a jacket or shell, and the excess waist material isn\'t enough to cause discomfort; a well fitting shell will simply pack it together.  At $25 I can\'t see returning it, as it\'s worth every cent paid, however if it were a $75 North Face or Patagonia item it would probably have gone back.

I have been wearing Asics for 20+ years, mostly the GT-2000 series and its predecessor.  I have noticed over the last couple of years that the GT-2000 series have not quite felt the same in quality and comfort.  I had recently checked out a professional reading blog comparing the GT-1000 and the GT-2000 series.  It actually made note that the GT-1000s actually felt a bit more like the older GT-2000s. So, I gave them a try.  They felt okay.  But I had also started looking at the Kayano\'s.  Amazon had a pair that was almost half off the original price in a decent color scheme, so I decided to give them a try.  Out of the box they were one of the most comfortable pairs of running shoes I have ever owned. Having used them for 3 runs so far, they have been amazing with great support and cushioning.', 'I have been running in Kayanos for over 20 years (1998). I also have an MS in Exercise Physiology and have taken enough anatomical kinesiology and biomechanics classes to say, with a certain degree of certainty, that every 3-4 years gremlins seem to take over the design of the Kayanos and manage to screw up a good shoe. However, the stars have aligned and all is right in the world again.....the 28s emulate many of their successful predecessors. Enough of my sarcastic wit. Seriously, I would like to know if any of the shoe engineers at Asics are runners themselves or if they utilize focus groups before they unveil some of the more recent disasters. Regardless, the 28s are a keeper!', ""I've had a pair of Kayano 20's for a few years now which have held up great and provided solid cushioning for close to 1,000 miles of mostly sub-5 mile runs. I now have about 400 mi on the Kayano 28's and there is clearly significantly faster wear taking place on the traction sole of the shoe vs the 20s. Perhaps traction is better with the 28's and that is the tradeoff, though I never noticed an issue with traction with the 20's. Perhaps the 28's are more cheaply made, but if so, the savings have certainly not been passed onto the consumer, as the 28's were more expensive than the 20's. Overall I like the shoes, they are very comfortable and supportive. The fit is great (went with wide this time as the 20s put a bit too much pressure on my small toes at the same size, 12 1/2). I just have a strong feeling I'm going to be worn through the soles in half the time (or even less than half) than the previous Kayano 20's."", 'I have been wearing ASICS my entire adult life.  The shoes are reliably comfortable and make taking every step as enjoyable as can be.  I wear mine 6 days a week and each pair lasts me around a year.  I think that for what I put them through these shoes have a fantastic and respectable life span and the price is right for the yearly replacement.  Its always a joy to see the new styles and I can have confidence that even if the colors change, the sizing is still the same.  ASICS for life!!!!', 'The Kayano 28 is meant to be a shoe with stability. Not all runners are build the same nor, importantly weigh the same.I\'m a 5 foot 6 inch 120 pound male, athletic build with a running back ground in track and cross-country running. I over pronate in both feet and more so in my right. My left foot is almost neutral. This gives me the advantage of seeing how shoes may work for both neutral runners and those who pronate.It was a hot, dry day when I tested the Kayano 28 on asphalt, concrete, hard dirt, grass, gravel-covered ground, a wooded trail and on a running track.  Oh, and on some stairs for stair work- more on that later. The Kayano is a road shoe first and foremost but can handle some light trail work.The shoe performed pretty well on all these surfaces but less well on gravel and it was a no-go on sand. No surprise there. it did okay on the light, groomed trail even as i was looking for rougher patches. it is a no go on technical trails which is no surprise.  And on stairs ... wooden stairs with good grip and nothing spaced too far apart. metal stairs are a straight out NO- that is super dangerous and you will have zero traction. It may look cool to do cardio on stairs to feel like Rocky Balboa but these shoes will not allow you to gain purchase on certain kinds of stairs.  For your safety, unless you got mad skills and a wish to break something, do NOT try running up and down stairs in the Kayanos. Walking- sure but be careful and aware.From experience, I am not sure how this kind of traction would do in wet conditions. the tread on the Kayaonos is pretty minimal and even tough it\'s AHAR, a fabulous material in its self, the tread design is best for flat, dry roads and other flat, even and dry, non-slippy surfaces.  Did  i repeat my self there? ....While the cushioning on the shoe felt nice after so many denser stability shoes i\'ve had, it was a bit too cushioned and there was not that much springy-ness as well.  When i ran on the track, which was a softer composite surface, it was like running on double cushioning which sounds nice but highlighted the shoe\'s biggest weakness and potential danger.it may be because I weigh only 120 lbs that there was not enough weight pushing on the cushion, but, this shoe was very unstable despite all its technology. I had to be very aware of how I placed my feet as I went trough my gait cycle or the mushiness would cause me to roll an ankle.  I tested them in all sorts of running modes, postures and techniques, etc ect - I ran track so basically did every kind of running style in them to test them out. This said, I decided to at some points to just ""trust"" the engineering and run with out thinking about my motion. the shoe in this case took over and did surprisingly well despite being unstable.  Doing this was risky and I felt that after a while the luck of it may wear off. and, in fact i had strained my ankle and Achilles tendon by the time I was done.  i did not  fully roll my ankle but repeatable came close.In many ways I should have known better. When i first put them on and stood up, I stumbles side to side as if the side walls of the mid sole were giving out. i have very good balance so this surprised me.After my test run, my left foot felt soso, not great but soso. My right foot, the one that pronates more, was not faring well as it was the ankle I had nearly rolled multiple times.  it took a few days for my ankle to recover but it could easily have been worse.Breaking the shoes in would have no effect since the Kayanos are so soft as is. it was like running on marshmallows.  While I can see potential in the 28th iteration, Asics needs to take more time to refine this shoe to be safe to wear for lighter runners.  For that, it needs to be less mushy and have a lower heel drop - that is the difference between the front stack height and the rear stack height.  It would also help if there were a bit more spring or responsiveness in the shoe as well.  The tread is almost too thin and could use a bit more. If the traction were a little more regressive, that\'d be a nice touch.In the end, I cleaned them up and sent them back.']"

I have a long, narrow foot (size 13) and these fit me perfectly. The arch support is great, not too much or too little. They have good grip indoors and outside. I have used them in rain and snow and they handle very well. I’m not sure why they have little pieces of material on each side of the stretchy material across the arch?

I will probably buy a second pair.', ""I retired a pair of these about 15 years ago and could not get a new pair of the same size and color at the time I wanted to order another pair; so, I ordered LL Bean's equivalent.I've been wearing LL Bean's equivalent shoe for the last 15 years now, and am very happy with them, but they're are beyond worn out now and falling apart, not acceptable for wearing on shopping trips, etc around town. The only thing I didn't like about the LL Bean's shoe was that I always had to pull the back tab to get them on over my heals when putting them on.  If I just slid my feet in unassisted and didn't bend over and pull on the tab they would squash down in the back and be all annoying until I stuck my finger into my heel and straightened it out. Now that I'm older with arthritis it hurt a little to bend over and use my finger to straighten it out.This time, Merrill's Mocs were available in my size and width, but not in my color choice, so I got a different color, because I really wanted Merrill Mocs like I had many years ago. And I'm NOT disappointed. I can slip them on 'single-footedly'; the backs are stiff and strong enough so that I don't have to use the available back pull tab.The only problem I found with these new shoes are, even though the arch supports are very good (I need arch supports in all my shoes), they are a little far back for my particular foot's arches so the front of my heel rides on them a bit instead of the inside of my arch. So, they're not quite as comfortable as I remembered them to be way back 15 years ago. I used to have a pair of Dr Shoels arch supports that you could customize by cutting some off the front and back to adjust them to one's particular foot profile. I may look around to see if they still have those and expirement with a pair.UPDATE: since writing this I did find a pair of Air Foam Insoles product by TopCare Health at my local Lowes Food Store. They are foam-inserts; not meant to be arch-supporting, but they work great. Very comfortable footwear now :)"", 'Looked for house shoes for a long time. Most slippers aren’t supportive enough for my arches. I like these a lot and could immediately tell they were for me when I first tried them on.

I was doubtful something so light could provide the same kind of cushioning and support I got from my 993s or 990vs.  Boy was I wrong.First, they\'re noticeable lighter...almost to the point of seeming weightless (probably the reason they named them Ghost).

I went for a few long walks on the beach this summer, and noticed a while later that the memory foam insole was worn down a lot soon after -- I suspect that the sand in my shoes abraded the soft material that covers the foam.

These very reasonably-priced shoes are extremely easy to slip on, and they have a full range of widths.  My only concern is that they may stretch a bit too much with regular use (I am heavier than most folks), and as others have noted in their reviews, it is likely that the soles will wear out relatively soon if they are used heavily for walking on pavement.  Given the price, comfort and very nice look of these shoes, I think they are a very good buy.

They also look good, and slip on easily. I always wore size 10.5 until about ten years ago when sizes seemed to become less standardized. Now I usually wear between an 11 and 12. In these shoes, I still wear the traditional 10.5 or 10.5 wide, so keep that in mind when you choose a size.The reason I need to keep buying new pairs, even if they still look good, is that the soles wear out quickly. Once the tread wears off the sole, they become dangerous. They wear down to flat, slick spots were they contact the ground. A little bit of water on a smooth floor becomes like ice at that point. It\'s a situation where I am surprised and almost fall because it takes so little water to make them slick once worn. That\'s when I replace them. I tend to get about a year from the soles. The uppers would last much longer.I wish the tread material was better, but I like the shoes, the fit and the comfort enough to keep buying them. They look good enough to wear as dress shoes, but are comfortable enough for business casual.The color ""New Brown Gradient"" is interesting (this is my first pair in this color). Most of the shoe is a fairly normal brown, but it gets very dark near the toe. It\'s not a gradual change along the shoe, it just darkens the last 1-2 inches at the toe. It kind of looks like you were walking through wet grass and got the toes wet. I think I prefer the solid colors, but it is fine.Buy them, but keep an eye on the tread and be very careful once it is worn down.', 'These are great all-purpose brown shoes.  Easy to slip on, supportive, and good with jeans or dress slacks - this can be a go to pair.

No complaints after many, many, pairs of these shoes."", 'I\'m a size 8-8.5 in women\'s but I got these in black in size 7 (which is equivalent to 8.5 women\'s) b/c I usually like to go up half a size in Merrell\'s hiking shoes (as opposed to their trail running shoes). These fit exactly the same as an 8.5 in women\'s. I read more than a few reviews that claimed these shoes run small and instructed people to go up at least half a size, but I would only do that if you\'re on the edge of your size (i tend to be in certain styles of Merrell\'s shoes), have wide feet, or plan to use inserts.I was worried these would be too hot for summer but they\'re fine! We\'ve had a bad heatwave the past 2 weeks and I don\'t find them particularly hot. I\'m really glad I didn\'t get the ""vent"" version because I hike every day with my dog and am really hard on my hiking shoes (I usually need a new pair every 3-6 months, no matter the brand). I\'ve owned a lot of different Merrell hiking shoes at this point (i usually just buy what\'s on sale) so I know I\'d tear up the ""vent"" fabric pretty quick on the vent version of these shoes. These shoes are heavy hiking shoes. They\'re still ""sneakers"" instead of boots, but they\'re probably the heaviest pair of hiking shoes I\'ve ever owned (i never wear actual hiking boots). I was surprised by how bouncy they still feel though! I guess that\'s one of the reasons they\'re so comfortable; i\'ve had hard hiking shoes and these definitely aren\'t hard!  You could run in them, but if you\'re a runner Merrell\'s actually makes a lot of different trail running shoes that would be better for that.I\'ve been hiking in them for the past month and my only complaint so far is the suede fabric: it\'s such a magnet for dirt and dust! I got them in the black/gray but ever since the first time I wore them they\'ve been covered with dusty dirt. No matter how much or how often I beat the dirt out of them they will basically always be tannish brown (the same color of the dirt where I hike).  It\'s bad enough that dust is always puffing out of them when I undo the laces. If you care about having a visible layer of dirt/dust on your shoes you might want to get them close to the color of the ground where you hike (although I suppose this could be different for people who don\'t live in a dry climate like i do?).I plan to update when these shoes crap out on me. I\'m curious to see how long the vibram soles last b/c I remember it only took me 3 months to wear completely through the last pair of shoes I had with ""vibram"" soles (probably 5+ yrs ago--back when Merrells was supposedly higher quality).  Of course these days I like to use shoe goo before it gets to that point, but we\'ll see how long it takes before i have to start smearing shoe goo on the bottoms to keep them from wearing all the way through.UPDATE: I just raised my rating to 5 stars because I\'ve been wearing these every other day since I bought them (so about the equivalent of 6 months) and they\'ve held up WAY better than expected! Most other hiking shoes (even of this same brand) would be trashed by now, yet I haven\'t even had to use shoe goo on them yet because the soles aren\'t worn through even a little. The treads are definitely getting worn and there\'s a tear in the tongue of one shoe, but neither of these things have created any problems yet (they don\'t even smell bad yet!). I\'m definitely going to stick with this brand and model from now on.  I think it helps that I never wore them in the rain (I\'ve noticed that every time I wear a pair of hiking shoes in the rain they seem to wear down really fast afterwards so now I only wear hiking shoes that I hate when it rains, which is easy considering it rarely rains here).', ""The first pair I bought somebody stole off the back of my truck! I guess that's how much people like these shoes. I do too! The thing I like most about these is how good they work and feel on my pedals when I ride MTB trails. The soles connect well with my flat pedals. And when MTB riding turns into Bike-Hiking these shoes are better than anything intended to be riding shoes. These ARE my riding shoes nowadays.

If you live in the desert these will keep you stable at a lot of angles very consistently, but I absolutely would not want to try to climb a tree in the rain in these and I'd be a bit careful on wet tile or metal even when flat, definitely watch out for rocks while on the trail.I've now had these shoes for a few months and the outsole is still in pretty good shape, with an average of 4-5 miles walked a day. I took em to the galapagos and I've taken them to wisconsin swamps and they worked decently well in both. On the other hand, parts of the inner materials are already fraying and falling apart. The quality of the various parts is very inconsistent.Speaking of wet conditions, these are not designed as water shoes but if you step into the sea with them they drain reasonably well and if you keep walking they dry out ok eventually, although it can take hours if you take them off and leave them to sit.

I bought a pair in size 11 and my toes just brushes front enough to become a little uncomfortable after a while.  That was because they felt great until I walked a couple of miles.  The newer pair is a half size larger and are much better.  Even so, the size 11 is more comfy than most other shoes.  I don’t like the laces but that is a minor point.  They are very thin and hard to grip and pull up tight.  That is easy to fix however and I won’t downgrade them for that.']"

No complaints after many, many, pairs of these shoes."", 'I\'m a size 8-8.5 in women\'s but I got these in black in size 7 (which is equivalent to 8.5 women\'s) b/c I usually like to go up half a size in Merrell\'s hiking shoes (as opposed to their trail running shoes). These fit exactly the same as an 8.5 in women\'s. I read more than a few reviews that claimed these shoes run small and instructed people to go up at least half a size, but I would only do that if you\'re on the edge of your size (i tend to be in certain styles of Merrell\'s shoes), have wide feet, or plan to use inserts.I was worried these would be too hot for summer but they\'re fine! We\'ve had a bad heatwave the past 2 weeks and I don\'t find them particularly hot. I\'m really glad I didn\'t get the ""vent"" version because I hike every day with my dog and am really hard on my hiking shoes (I usually need a new pair every 3-6 months, no matter the brand). I\'ve owned a lot of different Merrell hiking shoes at this point (i usually just buy what\'s on sale) so I know I\'d tear up the ""vent"" fabric pretty quick on the vent version of these shoes. These shoes are heavy hiking shoes. They\'re still ""sneakers"" instead of boots, but they\'re probably the heaviest pair of hiking shoes I\'ve ever owned (i never wear actual hiking boots). I was surprised by how bouncy they still feel though! I guess that\'s one of the reasons they\'re so comfortable; i\'ve had hard hiking shoes and these definitely aren\'t hard!  You could run in them, but if you\'re a runner Merrell\'s actually makes a lot of different trail running shoes that would be better for that.I\'ve been hiking in them for the past month and my only complaint so far is the suede fabric: it\'s such a magnet for dirt and dust! I got them in the black/gray but ever since the first time I wore them they\'ve been covered with dusty dirt. No matter how much or how often I beat the dirt out of them they will basically always be tannish brown (the same color of the dirt where I hike).  It\'s bad enough that dust is always puffing out of them when I undo the laces. If you care about having a visible layer of dirt/dust on your shoes you might want to get them close to the color of the ground where you hike (although I suppose this could be different for people who don\'t live in a dry climate like i do?).I plan to update when these shoes crap out on me. I\'m curious to see how long the vibram soles last b/c I remember it only took me 3 months to wear completely through the last pair of shoes I had with ""vibram"" soles (probably 5+ yrs ago--back when Merrells was supposedly higher quality).  Of course these days I like to use shoe goo before it gets to that point, but we\'ll see how long it takes before i have to start smearing shoe goo on the bottoms to keep them from wearing all the way through.UPDATE: I just raised my rating to 5 stars because I\'ve been wearing these every other day since I bought them (so about the equivalent of 6 months) and they\'ve held up WAY better than expected! Most other hiking shoes (even of this same brand) would be trashed by now, yet I haven\'t even had to use shoe goo on them yet because the soles aren\'t worn through even a little. The treads are definitely getting worn and there\'s a tear in the tongue of one shoe, but neither of these things have created any problems yet (they don\'t even smell bad yet!). I\'m definitely going to stick with this brand and model from now on.  I think it helps that I never wore them in the rain (I\'ve noticed that every time I wear a pair of hiking shoes in the rain they seem to wear down really fast afterwards so now I only wear hiking shoes that I hate when it rains, which is easy considering it rarely rains here).', ""The first pair I bought somebody stole off the back of my truck! I guess that's how much people like these shoes. I do too! The thing I like most about these is how good they work and feel on my pedals when I ride MTB trails. The soles connect well with my flat pedals. And when MTB riding turns into Bike-Hiking these shoes are better than anything intended to be riding shoes. These ARE my riding shoes nowadays.

The 1 M currently listed on Amazon at least looks completely identical to the Chinese, re webbing and sole based on the picture but beyond that I don't know. I haven't used the second one purchased at the same time yet. These were purchased for the gym & treadmill though I have done some street running. Both the Addidas & UA were listed as size 9.5.

Although I can't make an assessment only on the sole of the sneaker I don't believe the UA will stand up to heavy gym work (especially running) anywhere near the Addidas just based on the webbing material. The assessment is this: if you want a substantial gym and running shoe and don't mind the price definitely get the Addidas, it will last longer. If you want a comfortable light walking shoe at a much lesser price for day to day walking activities the UA is fine at the price point.

What a bargain they are!"", 'I needed new boots to replace my Timberlands which failed me after only 3 years of moderate use. Did a ton of research on the Moab\'s and the Targhee\'s. Despite some reviews about durability issues, I ordered both to check out. Got the Targhee\'s and they\'re pretty nice. Got the Moab\'s and was very suspect. They came in a non-branded box and the tags on the backside of the tongues showed ""Made in Bangladesh,"" and the stitching around some of the eyelets was sub-par (no, I\'m not a shoe stitching expert).I remembered reading another reviewer who stated that he had gotten a second pair of Moab\'s... first pair he loved. Second pair fell apart in months. He said that the first pair was made in Vietnam (I could be wrong) while the second pair was made in Bangladesh. I have no idea how the shoe industry works, but it feels like the Bangladesh versions are either fakes, or just a lower end version they sell for less? I went into the Merrell outlet near me just to see what \'real\' Merrell\'s looked like. All of the in-store shoes (Moab\'s or otherwise) were made in Asian countries, but none from Bangladesh.Aside from that, I did try on several pairs of Moab\'s while in the Merrell store. I was surprised at how not amazing they felt after reading so many positive reviews. They were decent, but they just didn\'t feel great for me personally. I can see how others could love them though. They\'re probably pretty nice once they break in.Anyway, if you\'re looking into getting these, just be aware that the Bangladesh versions might be sub-par or fakes. Again, I could be wrong and they might actually make some in Bangladesh, but I didn\'t see any tagged as such in the actual store.UPDATE: I took a photo of the Bangladesh tag before returning them. I also received a pair of Moab low\'s the day after this review and they came in an actual Merrell box and the tag looked like the tags I saw in store (this pair was made in Myanmar, which I did see in the store as well). I\'ve posted a photo of that tag as well. If you compare the tags you can see pretty obvious differences, even in the fabric the tags are sewn into.As for the low version of the Moab\'s... I unfortunately returned those as well. They feel like you\'re riding high on top of the shoes, vs in them. And the soles didn\'t feel that great either. They\'d probably feel a lot different after breaking in, but again, I\'ve committed to giving the Keen\'s a go instead.', ""Just getting into hiking and needed a boot for some ankle support and wetter weather.

shoes,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51J-vYWaSdL.__AC_SX395_SY395_QL70_ML2_.jpg,"[""These arrived today, and I'm very happy with them.  I am a woman who has worn Asics shoes for walking and for work for many years now.  I always bought Asics size 9 1/2 womens.  I felt somewhat confident ordering the men's 8 because it is 41.5 euro size, same as my women's Asics pairs.Really wanted the all-black color and the great tread on the sole - it is hard to find shoes with a good gripping tread.I read all the reviews before buying and many mentioned the glued in insoles.  They are coated on the back with stripes of very tacky adhesive and I was able to grab them with pliers at the edge and pull them out cleanly with a little effort.I pulled the insoles out with pliers to make room for Superfeet insoles which I need to wear in pretty much all my shoes.  Without the factory footbed I was able to fit the heavy Superfeet Copper Insole and it's just great to be able to fit those in there with a fair amount of sock.  I also modify the insole with a pad for Morton's Toe and there is no issue with room for all that sock, insole and pad in the roomy toe box.The shoe laces that come with these are thick and round and I didn't like them.  I had a pair of plain black ones from a previous pair of Asics that I wore out, I kept the laces when I thew the worn out shoes away, the laces showed no sign of wear.With the plain black laces that have a bit of a lower profile, these shoes look great!  I don't think they look any bulkier or different than women's Asics.I have a narrow heel and was worried about that area for fitting.  But one good thing about these shoes is that the back of the shoe where it comes up over the heel is pretty structured and padded, I need that, and also, I think it possibly comes up a little higher in the men's shoe than the women's.  This is good because the Copper Superfeet insole had raised my foot up too high in some women's shoes, to where my heel was popping up out of the shoe.One more thing I think is really important about this style.  I had a pair of Asics trail hiking shoes before, the Fuji Attack style.  These had a serious design flaw in that the back of the sole at the heel stuck out really far.  I guess this is supposed to give you stability.  It is a safety problem on stairs!  When you are going down a flight of stairs, that back of the heel sticking out so far, catches on the step if you aren't completely conscious of it for every step!  It seems really dangerous on stairs to have the back stick out so far.These don't do that, I could see in the pictures that they don't.  What a relief to find such a good pair of Asics at such a good price, the right color and so much good room in the toe box for the insoles and socks.  I had enough confidence that they would work out that after I ordered the first pair, I ordered another pair before the first one even got here.  It isn't often that you find a shoe that really ticks all the boxes like these do.  I have them on right now and they feel great.I'm going to pay attention to people's reports that they felt they were slippery on wet surfaces and I will make sure to wear them a fair amount of dry pavement to scuff up the soles a little and hope to alleviate any possible issue with slipperiness.Hope this helps someone and that some woman might read this and order a man's size with a little less trepidation.Can't wait to go for a walk!  I really needed these shoes, I didn't even realize how much I needed them until I got them."", ""I bought these shoes as an inexpensive shoe for adventure racing.

This only goes for runs. Seems fine for walking around, gym workouts, and short jaunts. It actually shines as all three of those latter mentions. I wear them with joggers for errands and laid back outings mostly as I have a pair of Altra Solstice XT 2s for gym work.', 'Edit to add: I wound up making 2 small scissor cuts on both sides of the tongue and it totally fixed the tongue pain. The tension was relieved and it is no longer digging into my skin. Going to order another pair now that I know the tongue can be easily remedied.—-These are my first pair of Altras. Just had my first run in them and was pretty impressed over all. I have been running in barefoot shoes for the last 12 years but after recent lower back trauma was encouraged to use something with some cushion.Other cushioned shoes were a bit too much in the heel drop or too heavy and really threw off my game, I wanted zero drop and these fit the bill. Zero drop with a thick cushion. The run felt great, the zero drop was comfortable for me coming from barefoot shoes, while the cushioning helped absorb impact and I noticed my back wasn’t sore at all afterwards, which it had been for a while with my barefoot shoes.I found the other reviews about sizing and the tongue to be on point. I originally ordered my usual size but had to return for a half size larger. The half size up is comfortable.The tongue is the only real weak spot of this shoe for me. I still gave it 5 stars because biomechanically I felt great on my run, but the tongue is a real head scratcher. It’s as if no one road-tested these before hitting the market. Even just walking before running I could feel the tongue cutting into the front of my ankle. Really, really poor design. The material is thin and stiff and WILL cut you up. I will probably try to cut the tongue with scissors to relieve the pressure as I prefer wearing no show socks. Workaround isn’t too difficult so I’m still a fan. Hopefully my next pair of Altras will have a better tongue, but in all other regards I love this shoe.Fingers crossed they have reasonable durability.', 'Nice running shoes. 0 drop is a nice feature of this shoe it takes a while to get use to but feels natural while running. The tongue is the only downside as other reviews say but manageable with higher running socks.Update: Shoe has started to fall apart only a few miles have been run with them. The plastic portion on the back tab has begun to come apart. Sole is practically new. Still a working shoe some of the construction I would say is poor', 'I’ve owned many earlier versions of the Torin and it is my favorite Altra shoe for comfort. I have two pairs of the Torin 4 which in my opinion is the best version. The Torin 5 is smaller with a slightly tighter toe box. I have always worn size 10 in Altra shoes, but with the Torin 5, I had to return a size 10 and get a 10.5. Once I got the larger size, the fit was right and I liked the Torin 5 a lot better. The tongue issue many have complained about hasn’t affected me since I wear ankle socks. Overall the Torin 5 is good but not quite as comfortable as previous versions. In spite of the changes, I still bought two pairs. I wish Altra would quit changing a good thing.', ""I knew when I got these that the tongue might be an issue like others have mentioned but with ankle socks, I don't feel it at all. I run, walk and work in these shoes and I have really enjoyed them. I really like the wide toe box and how cushioned these feel. They are very soft. It's like I'm wearing my Crocks! This is why I bought them in the first place. I have Morton's neuroma and these shoes seem to alleviate that pain. My main issue with these is that I can see the mesh material not lasting very long.

They have far exceeded any expectations I had.These though? Wow. These are the epitome of comfortable shoes. The coup d\'état of the shoe industry.

A whole mess of untying and adjusting shoelaces to get your foot into the shoe, only to redo all of it to ensure a snug fit. However, these shoes are engineered very smartly. The top is a very wearable, breathable, stretchy fabric, and the loop at the back for slipping them on is PERFECT. I can barely even tell I\'m wearing high-tops, they\'re so comfy.+ SPONGEY BOTTOM | I have NEVER encountered shoes with a bottom like these. And as everything else, I am blown away. Walking on these shoes feels like walking on a very comfortable sponge. I can\'t really describe it accurately, but even my own steps have never been so comfortable.+ THE QUALITY | You are buying these shoes for an absolute steal. The quality far exceeds most brands (Adidas, Nike, Sketchers, etc) and the price tag is SO. Much. CHEAPER. These shoes are an absolute steal.+ THE DESIGN | These shoes are, to say the least, INSANELY sleek and fashionable. They are by-far the most unique and nice-looking shoes I own. The first shoes I\'ve owned where you can just be walking and have someone say ""Hey, nice shoes!"" It\'s a great feeling.What are you waiting for... BUY THESE! If they match the outfit you\'re planning to buy, go for it. You will be satisfied 100%']"

Washington) and comfort, great weight.Cons: Quality and/or Durability is lacking/bad. Summary: A well-balanced and favorited shoe that is tainted by its poor integrity.Recommendation: Buy, but be warn that use, especially on rocking, high-elevation gain hikes, may lead to a short lifespan. _____Long StorySo I’m a weekend warrior hiker. Most of the time I stay in CT, with a White Mountain hike once a month, more or less. I’ve been using ankle-supporting boot user since I started hiking, but I was forced to get sandals for the Narrows, so I got these. Didn’t get to do the Narrows because of the water level, so I did Angel’s Landing with them. I have converted to a sandal user ever since. However, my experience with the H2s hasn’t been all positive.I’m going to use other shoes I’ve worn as comparisons to illustrate my pros and cons: Merrell Moab Mids, KEEN Targhee III Mid, Saloman X Ultra Mid, and Brooks Cascadia 13s, with rankings in each section ranging from great, good, okay, lacking, to bad.- Traction: Good.When I say good traction, I mean good traction once I learned how to hike with these. There was definitely a learning curve for me. Boot’s weight and distribution of force make it so I don’t have to really engage my feet when I hike, I just need to put my foot down. Hiking is just a walk with Moabs and Targhees. Not so with sandals. I have to think more, actually grip with my toes, take more consideration with my balance. It was kind of a turn off at first, because I was constantly slipping. This is a serious issue because the hikes I do always have steep sections. Wether it is Sleeping Giant’s Blue Trail’s 0.4 mi section up 500ft of slab or the 2,500 ft+ elevation gain bagging Mt. Tom and Mt. Field, I need shoes that will keep me grounded. All the initial slippage definitely made me miss heavy shoes with Vibram soles. But I don’t turn tail unless I have to, so I kept pushing, and eventually I learned how to hike in these sandals.I would say traction plus skill on the H2s would be the same as my Targhees. Moabs, with their Vibram soles, have great traction, and are unrivaled in my experience. HOWEVER, the H2s have greater flexibility and a sleeker frame that allows me to stick my foot in holds and hop on uneven boulders that I wouldn’t be able to do with boots. And, Unlike the lacking-traction Ultra Mids, I don’t slide standing on smooth New England trap rock with the H2s.- Comfort: Good.I used to be a big fan of Moabs because of the cushion. Those are the only hiking shoes I would rank great in comfort. The H2s are good for the complete opposite reason; there is no cushion at all. Instead, there are just straps. Unlike an enclosed shoe, my ankle and heel can move freely, without worry of friction. Unlike plush, which wears and becomes a blister-friendly area, straps don’t wear down, and can be better adjusted when my feet are swollen. I would have liked the ankle support to have better adjustability, but it was never a serious issue. The only reason why I wouldn’t consider these shoes great in comfort is the toe box was too narrow for my toes, which are longer than normal toes. This wasn’t an issue until I went downhill. Then my pinky toe would be bruised and bent to awkward angles.- Weight: Great.Weight was an issue for a while since I was used to heavier shoes that needed less effort from me to push into for traction. Like I said before, there was learning curve for me. If not for my trekking poles I would have slid right off Wildcat Ridge trail. I no longer slip after a couple of mountains.I also used to use only boots because I was afraid of twisting my ankles and general injury. Come to find out, I hike better with less weight on my foot. I can confidently say twisting my ankle hasn’t happened yet. Compared to nearly happening every three hikes with boots, this is definitely a plus.Take my other shoes as reference points. My Cascadias, which also rank great in weight, weighing a bit less than the H2s, are just plain uncomfortable to hike in. I always get bruises and blisters using them when doing 4+ miles cuz' of my toes. My Ultra 3s, weighing a bit more than the H2s and ranking good in weight, have traction that is not suited for New England + NY trap rock.- Quality and/or Durability: Lacking/Bad.Man, these shoes were a let down when it came to durability. The toe box is solid, so no knock on those. I would say the shoe seemed put together until mile 80-ish. But come on, these shoes are UNUSABLE now after ONLY a 100 MILES of use. Fine, including 8 White Mountains (Mt. Washington and Monroe up and down too!) and steep parts of other hikes, 70 of those miles were tough on these shoes. But shoes shouldn’t deteriorate like this. Last weekend, I went to the beach with my friends with the H2s on, and see what happened. The stitching came apart, something like cardboard came out, and the webbing, admittedly already breaking a bit due to descending the Jewell Trail, just kinda holed-up. The shoes are total fubar. This is sooo disappointing because the H2 became my favorite hiking shoe up until this point. I can’t say whether it was a durability or quality issue, but this is ridiculous. My friend’s plain Nikes, aside from being gym shoes, has been his go to for hikes CT and White Mountains for almost two years are in better shape than these. It may be a valid point to say these shoes weren’t meant for the punishment I’ve put them through, but I think there is a genuine problem when low-end Nikes hold better than the H2s under similar circumstances.The H2s balance traction, comfort, and weight to make hiking a more enjoyable experience, allowing me to hike longer. All the other shoes have their own balancing issues. My Targhees has good comfort and traction, but the weight is lacking. My Moabs have great traction and comfort, but bad weight (I know they should be lighter than the Targhees, but they aren’t for me on the trail). My Ultra 3s have good weight and comfort, but lacking traction which has lead to dangerous instances (almost sliding off Mt. Marcy’s summit). My Cascadias have good traction and great weight, but are not comfortable at all for my foot built (long toes). The H2s are well balanced; good traction, good comfort, and great weight. I just wish they were more durable. I don’t want to keep buying H2s every two months. Maybe it was a singular instance of poor quality, I’ll need to get in contact with KEEN to figure that out. But unfortunately, as is, I have to find another shoe for me."", 'A very sturdy well fitted shoe. I wore mine with socks for the first week or so and then it was fine.

So, I was shocked when I tried on this pair of Adilettes at a shoe store having been attracted to the colour - vintage green and off white with gold lettering.

I, at the time, was not prepared to deal with how comfortable they were but by the time I had gotten home I was feeling buyers' regret:  The regret of having not bought a pair.  So I took to the internet.  As there was only one size at the store, i didn't get a good feel for what size should fit me.  I'm between 9 and 10.5 US mens, depending on the shoe, so  I thought (and was correct) that 10 would fit perfect.  You'll hear folks complain that these shoes are sized too large, and indeed the footprint is a little larger than my actual foot, but had I bought the 9s, I suspect the width of my foot would not have fit in the slide at all.  As it is now, even though the sandal seems large, I have to really jam my foot into it.  In a few weeks, I'm guessing it will have stretched enough to fit perfectly and slide on easily.  These are far and away the most comfortable sandals I have ever worn.  A far cry from the slides i remember my friends owning back 20 years ago with the massaging foot nubs..

These are so terrific for support because the shoe insert cups your heels on both sides keeping foot in position. No more foot pain!', 'I have worn Birkenstock sandals for about 20 years now, usually getting a new pair every couple of years.  My most recent pair of leather Birkenstocks were literally falling apart and hurt my feet to walk in, so it was definitely time to replace them.  This being the beginning of summer I was looking to go with a more water friendly option since we had plans to go to the beach, camping, etc.  I arrived at these EVA Birkenstock sandals, and I was little leary.  Years ago I had a pair of rubber Birkis, they gave me blisters and smelled awful after a few weeks and needed to be scrubbed to get all the gunk out of the nooks and crannies of the footbed.  These are entirely different, and have a smooth footbed which does not collect gunk.  After the initial period of getting used to the softer, spongy footbed, I have decided that these are really great, a much better alternative to cheap flip flops that offer some foot support.Two issues I want to address based off of reviews I read prior to purchasing:I saw a lot of people claiming that they had to order a size smaller than what they wear in ""Normal"" Birkenstock Arizona sandals. I heeded this advice but ended up exchanging the sandals I initially received for my regular size.  I wear size 44 in leather Arizonas, and I find the size 44 in these EVA sandals to be the same fit.Secondly I saw some complaints that the footbed tore after a short period of time in front of the straps.  I believe this is due to the front edge of the sole being very squared off.  I was walking across my hardwood floor and caught the sandals on a joint between the boards, something I don\'t recall ever being an issue before.  These sandals are much more flexible and I nearly folded the toe under the sandal, which I think if this happened a few times would result in the damage I saw.  I used my belt sander to take the hard edge off and bevel it about 45 degrees.  The same could be done with a nail file, foot file, concrete sidewalk, etc.  Since doing this I have not had any more issues of this nature.Update 3/19:I\'ve retired this pair and replaced it with another of the same design.  I wore these nearly every day for about 8 months and I think I could probably keep going for a while but they are looking a bit worn.  I\'m impressed with these.  I feel as though I certainly got my $40 worth of use out of them.  When I got them in July 2018 I figured if they lasted to the end of summer I\'d be satisfied.  They definitely have done this and as I said continue to be serviceable, although most of the tread has worn away.  I expected by this point that they would have torn and been out of commission but they have exceeded expectations.  As a longtime Birkenstock wearer I have tried most of all their different lines.  As mentioned I used a pair that I imagine were a precursor to these, that pair had a hard rubber one piece sole with a synthetic upper.  I think it was the worst pair of Birkenstocks I\'d ever had so I was skeptical when I saw these and thought it might be about the same.  I\'ve been pleasantly surprised with how wrong I was, these have proven more durable, easier to clean off (hosing them off pretty much gets everything, no nooks and crannies for gunk to build up), and far more comfortable.  I expected at some point I\'d have to wash them with bleach due to odors but I\'ve never detected even a hint of foul smell.  For $40, these are a goo introduction to those who aren\'t ready to shell out the big bucks for the leather versions, and they are also a great deal for people who like Birkenstocks but need something waterproof (they don\'t soak up water either!).', 'I bought these to replace fifteen year old leather versions of the same Birkies.  Fit is the same, ""feel"" is not quite the same but since I use these for around-the-house slippers that is not an issue.

Took them back and bought a synthetic Birkenstock instead.It's good overall, with the same fit and support.

The part in contact with the sole gets sweaty, but at least it\'s leather so you get used to it. Because of the design, walking on the heal hasn\'t damaged them at all. When I go to the store or take a walk I tend to throw on some black cotton socks and honestly they breathe better than this way and tend to be less clamy. The grip these things have is incredible. I walk on trails and around the steep banks of water almost daily and these have much better grip than most shoes, and that\'s while I\'m still walking on the heal! When I put my foot properly within the shoes I can walk anywhere including up the steeply inclined dam wall that EVERYONE slips on. I really can\'t say enough about how impressed I am with these.

Sometimes even 10.5 fit me, but I had to get these in 12 and return the first ones I bought. That said, these now fit me perfectly, so I think that means they are narrow for the average 12, because I fit these in width and length.Supposedly these are waterproof, but they are made with genuine leather and of course water goes right through the gaping holes, so I have no idea what they mean by that.

I bought this sandal to wear hiking in the Rockies.  It was a good choice.  They do hold on to your feet at a steep edge.  I was descending on terrain I would not normally attempt in sandals. The straps held my feet without slipping and felt secure.  I had at first thought I made a mistake wearing these hiking but after reaching the bottom I was confident that they would work for a hike in the mountains.  A big advantage wearing these sandals is that your feet stay cool.  In hiking boots my feet get hot.The adjustment strap is a bit long but in my case it does not touch the ground.  I found it helpful to have the longer strap.  I could tighten the strap quickly when climbing and loosen it afterwards for walking on flat ground.  I like the snug fit when climbing but prefer a little looser when walking on a flat trail.Walking on a wet surface had the same grip feeling as wearing a hiking boot.  The bottom of the sandal does look like a hiking boot sole.I measured the weight of each sandal and oddly one weighs more than the other. The left sandal was 11.2 oz and the right sandal was 14.2oz.  This is for size 9.I also purchased the Chaco mega Z cloud and it too had different weighting per sandal.  And the right sandal was the heavier one.  Must be a manufacturing issue.  I don't notice the weight difference when on my feetThe straps didn't cause and irritation at all.  I wore them on several short walks before hiking a longer trail.  But I have been wearing sandals all day for 6 months or so and that might have prepared my feet for these straps.After about 1 day I started to feel like the heal was too narrow.  I ordered the medium width which is my normal width.  I stopped at a local shop and tried on a wide version of the same sandal and the heal was wider but it felt too wide, too much sliding around in the heel..  My foot had a bit of movement that I thought was too much.  After experiencing steep terrain I am glad I kept the medium width, you need a snug fit to walk a steep incline.  Any movement can throw your balance off.The width feeling was due to the cup at the heal of the sandal.  Most sandals are shaped at the heal.  However these sandals have a heel cup which has a different feel but it is what makes it possible to walk a rocky steep trail while holding your foot stable.The foot arch of the sandal is high. Much more arch than any other sandal I have seen.  And my foot does well after walking in them for several hours.  I feel the arch is really helpful.Summary, feels like wearing a hiking boot.  Highly recommend for trail use or walking in general.  I feel confident the straps will not break easily and I should get some indication when they wear out.  I have had other high quality sandals look ok but suddenly snap while wearing them.  Not great when a few miles outAfter wearing these sandals for a month or so I have found them incredible.  I prefer these over any other sandal or shoe for walking.

I have recently been into sandals but they don't have the stability of a shoe, nor do they have much in terms of arch support.  The open style is what I wanted but I also wanted something easy to clean.  I have suffered from plantar fasciitis necessitating injections with steroids so I don't take footwear purchases lightly.I discovered this brand through a recent patient who wore these sandals.  I noticed the arch support and the simplicity of design.  The Zvolv is lighter than the standard sandals.  It has a nice solid tread which is stable on grass, asphalt and different indoor surfaces.  The arch support is critical for me, as I pronate when I walk.  The footing is stable.I typically wear a size 10.5 US Men size. This size 10 fits me perfectly.  So if you are 10 or 10.5 go with 10.  There is a nylon strap that secures with a plastic buckle.  It wraps around the big toe and the ankle which gives excellent stability when walking.  I had no fitting issues out of the box. I just strapped in, and I was set.  I didn't find a need to do a break in.  They're already comfortable right out of the box.  The beauty of the system though is the ability to adjust the tension around the feet when you need to.The sole is flexible enough for hiking, walking or just casual use.  Its weight is just right - not too heavy and not flimsy, either.  I had great support and footing when hiking on a gravel trail.  The light weight was comfortable and I prefer these over using hiking boots on less challenging trails.Best of all, it's endorsed by the American Podiatric Medical Association.This won't be the only set I own."", 'I do not understand why this company is very lazy in the produktion of items to their customers.

The price.Is it worth it?That's really up to you, the specifics of your body & what you want out of them.FYI, this is a 1 year review & I wear these EVERY day for at least several hours.Sometimes all day but not all day every day.*apologies for how dirty they are in the photos*The Good:• Very comfortable to me & my size 12/13 wide feet• 100% leather touches your skin, it feels great... to me• Supportive enough but not overly so. This is very important to me as I wear flip-flops to allow my feet to move freely as compared to boots or shoes• Very Durable for what I use & wanted them for. Which is mostly as: house shoes, walking around town, shopping, beaches, & light trails - very light; minimal elevation changes & well kept. At 1 year of everyday use you can see that there is very little wear on the leather or the treads• Super Stylish - love the way these look! I mean just look at the details in the leather, the stitching, even the treads. Just beautifulThe Bad:• Expensive!!! The most expensive flip-flops I own BY FAR.That said, I certainly have/ have had sandals that are right up there & they haven't lasted & weren't nearly as comfy• Inconsistent / Quality Control Issues:  ▪︎This is my 2nd set of these. To be fair, maybe they just run big as my nominal size is 12.5 wide so I normally go for 13s when companies don't offer 12.5s but the 13s of these were HUGE. Didn't fit at all. Again, this may not be a fault of the company or the flip-flop  ▪︎ Inconsistency between each flip-flop. As you can see in the pictures. My left flip-flop has much more pronounced/deeper etching in the leather,  which I prefer for visual & functional (more on that later) reasons• NOT for water use - going back to those etchings in the leather. The right flip-flop has no grip at all on your foot while it's wet.  Very slippery. Even the deeper etched left flip-flop has very poor foot traction when wet. Also, I'd strongly warn against using these for water anyway because you risk damaging the leather unless you're very careful about not soaking them too long, drying them, & then treating the leather. Actually the only damage/ wear these have is from water damage. The right flip-flop's leather has cracked right behind the ball of my foot but it's still very serviceable.Conclusion:These are a very well made, beautiful, comfortable & durable flip-flop depending on your intended use for them.These are best suited for: walking around your house, on well maintained terrain, & for strolling the sands on the beaches but you should kick them off before getting to the waterline.These things are EXPENSIVE & they aren't made for hard work or tough terrain so keep that in mind.I'll try to update if anything changes or at the 2yr mark. Whichever happens first.Hope this helps someone decide.Take care everyone. 🙂""]"

They replace Vionics-brand slides I have been wearing, my final pair of the three pairs of this now discontinued item I bought now having given up the ghost.  I specifically bought these and those because of the bold/broad cross band design.  I like this design because I know from years of past experience that this design is excellent for all day, do anything, wear.  (I know this because I literally climbed a mountain in Asia while wearing an foam rubber pair of this design years ago when I wore this style for everything, obviously).It is surprisingly difficult to find a pair like this that has the cross band design that doesn't also look like a pair of clown shoes emblazoned with trademark paraphernalia.  Yes, this pair does have the Rockport symbol on its strap but it is mercifully small and unobtrusive.So, on style and design, this pair is right on point.  The only other things one needs worry about is fit and wear.  I admit to having reservations about the puffy, nylon foot bed.  My fear was/is in two parts: A) the puffy bed would be slippery and not well-suited to long and hard use, including running or jogging.  I am happy to report that I have made multiple extended walks amounting to miles of foot padding and these do work well for this application.  They do not, however, run well causing one to have to scrunch one's toes to keep them in place.  Having said that, I realize that most people do not buy these to go running in so I will table that complaint.B) I feared the slick nylon footbed would become sweaty and smelly from retained foot fluid and accumulated foot grime; many other slides and slippers having a rubbery or nylon foot bed that works as a solid surface.  I am happy to report that these slides don't cause one to generate excessive foot sweat and they have remained remarkably fresh looking even as I use them more and more.I am very, very pleased with this pair of sandals and will definitely buy another pair when these wear out.  Plus I recommend them to every one."", 'After wearing these sandals for a little while, I noticed on my right foot the toe is getting irritated by the seams on the inside of the leather  - so that is not a good thing, little disappointed.(updated)Rockport Men\'s Darwyn are excellent and fit me like a glove !

But once they do, they are very comfortable and keep your feet anchored in place. The style is simple and not very exciting, but these are intended for long hikes, not fashion. The sandals are heavier and stiffer than most other Teva offerings. They are very comparable to Chacos or the Bedrock Cairns.The break-in process, unfortunately, can be very painful. Due to the way the sandals are constructed, they will do a lot of rubbing against your heels. The result can be chaffing, blistering, or something in between. It's not pleasant and it can take many days to fully break-in. This is the unfortunate reality of virtually all footwear, but given the stiffness of these sandals, it's particularly pronounced. So be prepared to have some messed up heels for a few days. But once they are broken in, it's worth it.GO DOWN A SIZE! I normally wear a size 10, but the Terra Fi size 10 was too large. Had a lot of space in front of my toes. Going down to size 9 made a huge difference. (Tevas in general seem to be fairly big so I'd recommend going down 1-2 sizes). You want the front straps just behind your toes, not covering them. Getting the sizing right is very important with any pair of sandals, especially ones like these that are intended for long hikes. You will absolutely hate the look and feel of these sandals if the sizing is wrong.The Terra Fi can weigh you down as it is intended for serious hiking and multi-day trips. They are overkill for everyday wear and most light hiking. If that is what you are interested in, I would recommend the Hurricane line over the Terra Fi. The Hurricanes are lighter and have a softer footbed, available in more colors, and is geared more towards less strenuous activities, while emulating the look of the Terra Fi."", ""I've worn Teva sandals for at least 16 years and these are now my favorites the arch supports are perfect for my high arches and my feet are happy doing my daily four-mile walk."", 'These are great versatile sandals.

At the same time, I ordered a near-identical shoe in a different color that was leather, so I\'ve had the opportunity to compare.  The leather one has a tighter fit in the straps, probably because it is expected to loosen over time.  This one has a looser fit, so presumably it will not need to be adjusted over time (I believe this is what the ""does not need to be broken in"" claim refers to).  I\'ve also noticed that this one feels warmer on my feet than the leather one, at least where the straps cover.Had I realized this wasn\'t leather, I would have ordered a different style, but now that I have it, it seems to be fine.  I\'m curious to see if the straps last as long as the more traditional leather straps do.Side note on sizing:  I wear an 8.5 to 9 in women\'s shoes, and a 38 fit my feet near-perfectly.

As it is now, even though the sandal seems large, I have to really jam my foot into it.  In a few weeks, I'm guessing it will have stretched enough to fit perfectly and slide on easily.  These are far and away the most comfortable sandals I have ever worn.  A far cry from the slides i remember my friends owning back 20 years ago with the massaging foot nubs..

I've even bought good pairs from Reef and Skechers and always end up irritating and blistering my feet badly. I guess my feet are just very sensitive and I almost thought that I can never wear flip flops since my feet irritate so easily.So fearing another painful walking, I decided to try these Sanuk Fraid Not flip flops thinking I was going to end up with blisters again. Well I tried them on and walked for over 4 miles in them and they were GREAT! No irritation or blistering whatsoever! And this is without breaking them in too!! They are comfy right from the start!! I cannot believe I finally found a pair of flip flops that agree with my feet. I was a little worried at first because the straps seem to be a little on the rough side, so I thought they were going to rub the wrong way, but they didn't. I think the reason is these flip flops are so light so they don't pull and dig the straps into my feet and the straps are not too tight where they rub and dig the wrong way. They are made just right.A couple of gripes however... since these are so light, I don't expect them to last long. I probably will wear them for the next two months until summer ends. But once summer ends, I expect that these will need to be tossed as they will probably start to fall apart. But maybe I might be surprised, but they do feel a bit flimsy so I'm not keeping my fingers crossed. But hey, these flip flops are extremely light and comfy. So you can't have it both ways, so I won't knock down a star on my rating. Another gripe is, the arch support is lacking. But my guess is that the lack of arch support helps keep these flip flops light. Reef flip flops have good arch support, but they are heavy and the heaviness of the flip flops causes it to pull the straps into my feet and irritate it with every step I take. So again, not going to knock down a star. Both flaws are trade-offs to help keep the flip flops light and comfy. And that's what matters to me.These are quite pricey at $30 a pair and since they probably have to be replaced every season, these can be quite costly. But they are worth it! They are extremely comfortable and when hot summer kicks in, it's always great to have a comfortable pair of open-toed footwear, which in my case, is not easy to find."", 'Great look.

Those other flip flops may be cheaper but break a whole lot faster. I would have bought 5 new pairs of those since the time I bought these.

You generally find something that's comfortable and available, and stick with that brand and size. For me, it's been New Balance 14 extra wide for the last 20 years or so (yes, I'm a dad, and old). This has been fine for sneakers, and I even got a pair of NB hikers that have been working pretty great for me.My family and I love the beach, and every time we find ourselves shopping at the beach, I instinctively check the flip flop rack for something in a 14. To this day, I've never seen anything on those racks above a 13. So I went to Amazon, found a nice looking pair of flip flops, and the largest size they had was a 14. Figuring I could return if it didn't fit, I pulled the trigger. When I got them, I couldn't even get my toes past the straps.

Going zero drop, barefoot has done my body a lot of good, I think. When I walk with them on, my feet still feel tired, but the way my legs are sore is new, and I can tell I am using muscles that haven\'t been used in a long time.I\'ve been solely using my Z Trails as my ""popping out to the store"" and ""walking the dog"" shoes to help me ease into them and I think that has been a beneficial approach, and now I am taking 2plus mile walks and hiking in them.  Walking takes some getting used to if thick soles are what you are used to, you gotta me mindful not to hammer your heel down over and over - although the 10mm is more than enough cushion at the end of the day, when walking on cement, crazy foot striking will result in sore bits.Hiking was a magnificent experience in these sandals! Even clambering down steep sandy unstable slopes I felt sure footed because I could feel everything. Small sharp rocks are really no problem at all, and I actually find that I prefer feeling them (but the 10mm sole keeps them from hurting my foot) because it makes me naturally more careful and I haven\'t slipped yet. And something I never thought about when first getting these sandals is that when tiny pebbles do inevitably get stuck between my foot and the sandal it\'s so simple and easy to get them out because of the minimalist style of the thing! My feet are out in the open and working hard, and it feels great.A few quibbles, now. Adjusting the sandal takes a bit of work. If you go onto the Xero website you will see a video of the owner very easily demonstrating/explaining NOT to use the velcro hell to get in and out of the sandal, but rather the strap tightener...that is easier said than done. You can\'t put them on standing up at all, you have to be sitting down, with your legs crossed over, and the strap fastener is on the OUTSTIDE of the foot, resulting in an awkward angle - especially for a big person...and the strap is a bit stubborn in allowing the strap to slide easily to and fro for a good fit - it takes some work. Furthermore, you pretty much have to be touching the bottom of your sandal to put on and adjust. Maybe it\'s just me, but that is something I really wish I didn\'t have to do, because then I have to immediately wash my hands afterward - which often has me walking through my ""no shoes indoors"" house wearing my sandals, which defeats the purpose of the no shoes allowed part. As well as when I am out, say at the beach, putting them on requires again all that bottom shoe contact with no real place to then wash my hands. I admit, this issue my be mainly my own personal picadillo, but long story short, it could be...it SHOULD be easier to adjust these straps.And finally - when these babies get wet, such as stepping through a stream or stomping around beach water - the top of the soles get SLIIIIIICK. You have to have these pups strapped on right and tight or else your foot will slip in ways you really don\'t want to be slipping. They do dry in minutes, however.But even with those issues and my cleanliness neurosis going on in my head...I still love these sandals. I\'m hoping that more mileage will result with resolution, and I can\'t see myself going back to thick soled sandals at all.', 'I wanted a barefoot sandal for summer. I wanted something without padding or arches- they hurt my feet. I also wanted something to hike in, the soles of Tevas and Keens hurt my feet. I read the reviews and decided to give them a try.

You foot will also feel the hard concrete so make sure thats want you want. 2nd I agree with other reviews the durability is not there.

Now the foot beds feel like they are 5 years old right out of the box.The straps are loose and the foot bed is very soft. It is important to know that I have a very wide foot so you\'d think that loose straps still might be ok for me, but even with my wide feet you could see space between my skin and the straps. For people with a narrow foot or just an average foot width, these shoes will never work.  Plus with wear they are going to stretch more.  If you have very swollen huge feet they might be ok for you but the foot bed is still soft which will be a problem as they will wear out quicker.If you look at my attached photo, you can see that the problem appears to be that the toe stem is simply not shoved down into the shoe as much as they used to.  The shoe on the left is the new version, the shoe on the right is my old sandal from years ago.  This is why there is too much \'space\' and the straps are not snug like they used to be.I spent hours on the phone and emailing with Vionic customer service to try and find out of this was a temp error that they knew about and were fixing or if this is their new sizing and design but their customer service was a disaster.  One rep said she never hear of the problems I was explaining and another rep said she was receiving a lot of the exact same complaints.  All they have to do is look at the reviews (complaints) on their OWN website and learn how everyone has this same complaint. It was very difficult to get anyone on the phone and after about 12 emails I only got 3 responses and none answered my question.  They clearly just don\'t care. I understand that they have a few call centers throughout CA, and some reps work from home so there is no standards or oversight to their customer service dept.  I asked for a manager and was told their was none, and I believe it.The customer service dept also advised that the firm would not make any changes if ""just 50 people complained"" but they would do something if it were 100\'s of complaints.  Perhaps if their dealers could pass along their feedback (and return stats) perhaps then corrections could be made.  Their Better Business Bureau page is full of complaints mostly about people returning the shoes and never getting their refund.It seems Vionics doesn\'t care one bit about customer service or the end user.

Quarter inch thick, two fingers wide. I quickly had visions of falling on me arse, and having to pay for apartment repairs. I took precautions and put a piece of cardboard behind it so it wouldn\'t damage the wall too bad. The version I received had thicker stops against the doorway so I didn\'t need to add socks to cushion it, although that\'s an option.Honestly it was pretty time consuming to assemble. It came in a billion pieces, and although it did come with tools they were barely adept at the job. After \'securing\' only 4 of the nut/bolts I made a trip to the hardware store to pick up an adjustable 10"" wrench. I\'ve really wanted a fantastic wench for a while so it wasn\'t a waste of money to me.  I got the wrench home and proceeded to assemble, this time it was much easier on many orders of magnitude and gratitude. I went back to my original 4 and re-tightened them, chortling about how pitiful a job of securing the nut/bolt the tools had been.I cleaned the area and cut the cardboard to size and fitted the pull up bar on the doorway. At first I supplied very little weight to it just to test. I assembled my gym rings and some resistance bands and tried some workouts. Things seemed to be going quite well!Eventually I got brave and did stuff like lean at almost a 45 degree angle away from the brace to do ring exercises and it seems to hold. I only heard a creek just once and I lessened the degree. It seems to transfer significant weight to the support bars against the doorway. Not only that but the wide rear support helps transfer weight into the wall, not just against the pitiful moulding. Good news for me since I\'m a big guy.... 6\' 287-291lb. No I have not put my full body weight on it nor will I.If I had to recommend upgrades to make this thing bulletproof I\'d say spread the weight over a larger area on the rear hookup. And the heavily padded bar which pushes against the doorframe needs to be larger and also spread over more area. Making it flat with a foam rubber padding would be smart, instead of round, which would tend to transfer weight all to one spot - even if it\'s padded.Overall I am very happy with my purchase thus far. It got great reviews in general and seems to hold up.We\'ll see what time does to it.

I have had cheap ones last longer.', ""TL;DR -- The best sandal I own.THE BAD: Basically, from they are a little taller than most flip-flops. They have the sole of a regular shoe so shorter people might like that. However, I'm used to flip-flops not giving you any height so it feels and looks weird to me. The step (how it's curved up at the bottom in the toe area) is pronounced so you won't stub your toe. However, I can't get the image out of my mind that these have the shape of a clog. I'm a guy so I'm not into that.Lengthwise, do a half size larger, if not a whole. My heel is almost right at the edge so I'm going to keep these. 90% of my shoes are size 11, so I bought 11 in these. I wear many brands of shoes and it's pretty consistent. I should have gotten a half size bigger, but they'll work. Other reviews here will say to go a whole size up. Maybe order 2 sizes to try with Amazon Wardrobe?That said, the bad things aren't that bad at all.THE OKAY: The top straps are somewhat loose because I have a thin foot. Because of that, sometimes that makes them make that flapping sound. However, perhaps that will fade after a few wears. This is a problem lots of people won't have.THE FANTASTIC:The inner lining of the top straps is lined with wetsuit-like material, not the material on the outside. This makes it incredibly comfortable. No chaffing at all.The footbed on these things are amazing. I've never owned crocks, but it has that look and foamy feel. There is ample arch support which lacks in most flip-flops. The heel cup is a new concept to me in a sandal and it's awesome too. All these things combined with the step, the whole sandle just cradles your foot. No doctor would recommend wearing flip-flops, in fact many podiatrists tell you to never wear them. However, if they had these maybe they would. Maybe.The traction is awesome and it will make you sure-footed wherever you roam. No problem wearing these in rough terrain or the urban landscape. Some might think the traction is over-kill, but one of the reasons I tossed out a lot of my old flip-flops is because a couple times in my life I slipped on wet cement or wood because of bad traction. In both cases, it was like a cartoon event. When I slipped, my body was high in the air and completely level to the ground. I'm lucky my landing didn't break my wrists, so I'm good with a little extra traction.Great Value. Totally worth the price!10/10!Compared to others I have owned:Chaco Flip 9/10North Face 8/10Birkenstock 7/10"", 'Son muy cómodas y resistentes.Gracias!', 'Lasted less than 3 months with regular but not every day use.']"

For me, these are the best, most comfortable flip flops I've ever owned. I require arch support and these do the trick. Thought I would try a less expensive brand that advertised arch support. Wore them for a while and then put on my old Chacos. The arch support in the five year old Chacos was far superior. So I ordered another pair. What I really appreciate in the Chacos is the location of the strap that goes between the toes. Most flip flops have the strap too far forward for me. Thus my big toe is partially over the front edge and because I have wide feet, my little toe is barely on the flip flop. This also leaves quite a bit of room between my heel and the back of the flip flop allowing it to throw mud/sand up the back of my legs. The Chacos have the strap a little further back eliminating the big toe and heel problem. This also locates the wide part of my feet in the widest part of the flip flop eliminating the little toe problem. So many problems solved for me."", 'These are well made. My only wish is that they had a wide version.', ""I have been using Chacos Ecotread flips for more than 10 years, and was disappointed to see that they had stopped making them.

They are nowhere near as durable in the foot bed as the Ecotreads, but comfy and supportive.It turns out that my girlfriend went ahead and just bought all of the random items I had saved in my cart as possibilities, which I may or may not have bought.I have to say I’m actually very pleasantly surprised. I actually like this version much better than the old version that I have been using for years. They are only a little bit softer and they actually cradle the foot a little bit better with a slight lip all around the sandal, like a very mild version of the Birkenstock toe. Not only that, they don't have the soft foam foot bed like the Olukai, but rather a nice supportive rubber footbed that is reminiscent of Ecotread, but a tad softer.I went ahead and bought a second pair just in case Chakos changed their design based on bad reviews.

The sandals fit longer, which is good for narrow footers. If they had an ankle strap these would be AMAZING. Read more for details.Fit:I have narrow feet, and these fit perfectly. I\'m usually a 10.5 and decided to round down. I simply adjusted the many straps for a great fit. Wide footers MIGHT be OK doing the same, but I would suggest rounding up for the best fit.Materials:The straps are strong and the material touching your foot is soft. The straps are attached to the sole by glue which I don\'t mind. Depending on your use case the softer material that touches your foot might dirty on the beige version. If you have the white or black version, you might not have to worry about that as the material is black on those versions. The cushion/sole is EVA, or something like it, and is still comfortable.Durability:I\'m using to have something more secure than slides and possibly more durable.

For me that means I purchased this jacket for temps between 35 and 60. I wouldn't want to rely on it any colder than that. For that purpose, it does extremely well. I don't feel too hot wearing it in the upper 50s, and as long as I don't spend hours outside when it's in the 30s, it keeps me warm.My only knock is that the sizing feels like it is from 20 years ago when everything was a bit more loose fitting. That's good if you want to layer up, but the styling is not the current trend of slim/ form fitting.

But with this coat is it’s slightly tight but now unbearable.', ""Is this the best puffer jacket you can get? Probably not. Is it a fantastic value, high-quality puffer jacket for a fraction of the price of others? You betcha. Very pleased with this jacket. I did order a size up and I'm glad I did. I typically wear an XL, but I ordered an XXL so I can wear it over thicker hoodies and sweaters and I'm glad I did. I don't think the XL would be as comfortable over bulky layers. The XXL is almost too big though, I wish there was like a 1.5 or something. But I'm still very happy with it. It's a higher quality jacket than I was anticipating. It's very lightweight and packs up super small when you need it to. If you're looking for a quality jacket for chilly weather, you won't be disappointed.""]"

While I own several coats and jackets that keep me warm during those few times, they are too warm the rest of the time.  I needed something light, something to keep off a chill while holding off the wind and the occasional light mist.  Enter two great choices:  The London Fog Auburn Jacket and the Weatherproof Classic Golf Jacket.  Both jackets were available from Amazon at reduced prices so I bought both.  The bottom line is I like both and I'm keeping both.  Both are similar and both are winners.  My advice is to buy based on color and cost because you can't really lose.The Weatherproof Classic Golf Jacket differs from the Auburn Jacket by having knit cuffs and bottom edge.  The Auburn Jacket has elastic in the bottom edge and the cuffs snap closed.  I have no preference either way.  The outer fabric of both is microfiber polyester (whatever happened to poly/cotton twill, I wonder).  Both feel like the same weight and look like they could have been cut from the same bolts of cloth except for the colors.  The liners are a little different with the Weatherproof being slightly heavier but in no way bulky or thick.  The Auburn has a lighter feeling fabric inside.  Again, I have no preference either way.  Fit-wise they are very much alike.  The Weatherproof is a little longer in the body than the Auburn when the Auburn is bought in standard sizes.  Personally, I probably should have gotten the tall size of the Auburn but reviews indicated the Auburns sleeves are a bit too long and tall sizes usually have even longer sleeves.  I'm almost exactly six feet tall with a long torso so I can usually go either standard or tall without either seeming off.  I ordered the Auburn in standard length and it's okay but just a tad short.  However, I wouldn't want the sleeves to be any longer.  The Weatherproof fits me perfectly in length and the sleeves are okay too--not as long as those on the Auburn.  I ordered XXL in both jackets and I cannot detect any difference in the fit around the chest or waist.  They're roomy enough in my case for wearing a heavy sweater if need be.  I've worn them with thick sweatshirts but nothing heavier.I've worn both jackets in 45F weather but not in the rain.  Both cut the wind well.  I don't expect either to be waterproof like my Eddie Bauer rain parka.  Probably fine for a light mist or a quick shower.  What I find so great about these jackets is that they're comfortable over a wide range of temperatures.  I can wear one while driving without having to deal with the bulk of a heavier coat and I can wear it indoors for extended periods without feeling overheated.  Even on cold days, I usually only need a jacket for those times I'm outdoors between buildings or from the car to a building.  I only need a really warm coat when I'm outside for more than a few minutes.Which to buy?  Both are great.  I have a tan London Fog Auburn and a light blue Weatherproof Classic Golf.  Both colors will coordinate and match with other colors fine.  The London Fog has more color choices here on Amazon so that might be a factor.  My decision was made based on price.  At the time I bought both jackets, the prices were at a low point and both jackets were bargains.EDIT 01/18/2019:I've worn both these jackets for a while now and I have to give the edge to the London Fog.  That's based on a couple of things about the Weatherproof that wasn't evident at first.  Mainly it has to do with the knit cuffs on the Weatherproof.  In a very short time, they are beginning to pill on the right side of my jacket.  I'm not sure this speaks well for the quality of the fabric for the longterm.  Another thing I did not notice early on is that the cuffs on the Weatherproof do not match.  The left cuff's knit is different from the right.  This might explain the pilling of the right cuff.  However, I admit I like the way the knit cuffs fit compared to the snap cuffs of the London Fog.  On the London Fog, the cuffs feel either too tight or too loose, depending on which snap I use."", 'Great jacket! I ordered this for work and I love it!

It does better than my faux fur and leather coat at making me feel warm, so 10/10 on being a winter sweater.My sister also bought one(black), and the sewing on her sleeves was a little shabby because of the nature of trying to sew two things together without taking a million years to make sure they're perfectly aligned. Mine (gray) was fine though. I normally appreciate the extra length but it's not hard to take the sleeves in a little to make it have that more fitted look. And when I zip it up there's not as much of that dreaded puff that makes me look even fatter. I think it was designed well with a good, deep hoodie that still works when I wear a bun or a hat (If you look closely, it has the middle stripe of extra fabric that makes it actually big enough for heads).Works pretty great in rain, I think because of the thick layers. I've worn it in bad weather like that twice now, and it's kept me pretty good and dry until the outer layer looks like it's gotten fully soaked. So it's good for when you have short walks in anything but the heaviest rainfall in my experience so far.There are two layers throughout the sweater. They're both thick, and the arms don't have the lining on the inside of the torso and hood, but an extra layer of the outside material. I like the decision, the sleeves would have been too cold for the target weather otherwise. Either way, the material does not feel too synthetic in my opinion. I like it.Overall, 10/10. If you can mend this sweater does not take a lot of effort to make it have a more custom fit, and it's well designed. It doesn't fall into the common sweater traps, and it's compensated for the things it can't do (like anticipate every body type on the belly-pudge). I'll probably end up buying another one."", ""So first off, I never expected this to be the softest, most comfy hoodie I would own. I also didn't expect it to be so warm and well equipped to withstand the ungodly cold that we just survived (an endless stretch of single digit cold.. What!?!?), but after a long cold snap, several night time outings and some long winter weather woods walks with the pups, I've come to realize that this is one of the warmest, most essential jackets I've ever had. It's thick without being ' A christmas story' style constricting, and comfortably warm without making me sweat or overheat. The soft inner lining is great, and provides that perfect in between I'm always looking for.. And have never found until now! It fits well and the hood is the perfect size and doesn't hug to tightly or hang off of me. In other words it fits well, warms quickly and is effectively the warmest and most useful winter hoodie I've found so far! Amazon genuinely nailed this one!"", ""I got a red one for my dad to go with the Santa hat he got for Christmas with the grandkids.  He tried it on and almost hasn't taken it off since.  He never thanks me for much of anything, but he thanked me for this.  He usually wears an XL or maaaybe a L in most brands and the XL fits nicely.  The thick lining does not make it too bulky over a couple of shirt layers.  I told him it comes in other colors, since he doesn't usually wear red, but he just wants to stick with this one.  It's not a very bright red, so it didn't match the Santa hat the best, but apparently it matches his lifestyle perfectly."", 'very nice sweater for the price. overall the fleece is not tooo thick and not too light . once you wear it feels like a regular hoody in terms of the thickness of material. not sure if this is normal for fleece lined sweatshirt like these, but every now and then i feel the wind through the materials.Tried it on when I first got it > fits like i wanted.

I deducted a star because the zippers though functional aren’t especially high quality. Not flimsy but not as smooth as you would find on more expensive bombers. The zippered arm pocket is mostly for styling as it’s very difficult to open while you have the jacket on, so unless your comfortable taking it off each time you want to take out something you’ll want to use the internal pocket instead.

First impression is that it is more hefty than I expected, which is a good thing. For warmth, I would say that it\'s warm enough for fall/spring in my area (mid-Atlantic), especially if you put a good base layer under it. But it is not heavy enough for winter, which is fine. I bought this as a cool weather jacket and have heavier jackets for colder weather. Water does bead a bit on the outer fabric, but I\'ll probably wax it if/when that beading starts to go away.The ""barley"" color that I got matched the Amazon photos pretty well. At first glance (and in the Amazon photos), the shirt appears to have a rugged, worn-in look with a bit of natural color texture from ""wear"". But it\'s not color texture, the outer fabric actually has a bit of sheen that reflects light giving that effect. The fabric also has an unexpected feel: Instead of a slightly coarse cottony feel, it has a smooth satiny feel. And the cloth is very tightly woven - more so than your usual work shirt. None of this matters to me as I like both the look and feel of it. But if you\'re particular that a shirt like this should look and feel a certain way, then you may not like it. The inside is lined with cotton flannel for the torso and polyester for the sleeves. Lining the sleeves with a slicker cloth makes it easier take off without accidentally turning the sleeves inside-out, but if you prefer maximum insulation, polyester is not ideal.The sizing was pretty true to the chart. Maybe just a tad bigger, but not much. Be aware that it\'s not a modern slim fit though; it\'s a regular or classic fit. I\'m 6\'2"" and 210 lbs and the LT size fit pretty ideally with the sleeve cuffs folded up, which is what I wanted. I recommend taking measurements of yourself to ensure you order the right size. A few minutes of effort before you order could avoid several days of delay and a lot of hassle after.', ""I purchased this jacket along with a Legendary Whitetails Buck Camp flannel shirt, both in size large, and both of them fit more like an extra large. My closet is nothing but size large for shirts and jackets, and while most brands have some variation in their sizing, these were just ridiculous.

There's a reason I don't wear medium, because it's too small across my chest and shoulders... and would you believe it their medium fits exactly like a medium. lol.

Working very well. The best part about this jacket is that it has several pockets including hand pockets that make your personal inventory of miniature, small items to be placed and makes it versatile for your personal security. Also, including the reflectors. Moreover, I love that it has an detachable, zipping hood that you can adjust the tension of it depending on what conditions you are facing and whether or not you need the hood. The hood also can be enclosed using straps and is foldable to make it less bulk. In relation to the bottom section of the jacket, you can adjust the tension there as well by the tensioner strings located at the bottom, hidden from the inside of the jacket; as you tighten the tension, the tension at the bottom of the jacket becomes more slim and makes the jacket get closer to your body for extra warmth. Despite being fairly lightweight as it has some weight put into it, I will give this weight a pass.The only thing I encountered that was wrong with the jacket is that one of the front snap buttons came apart as I was unbuttoning it; the knit wasn't strong enough to secure the button, but that was only the lower button in the front.Ultimately, the last thing I despise about the jacket is that it's not equipped with zippers for the front side hand pockets. I have lost one of my gloves because the pockets weren't deep enough and was expecting that all the pockets would have zippers.

(I\'m 5 10, average build)This coat is thin (not puffy), yet feels heavy. It keeps the wind out and keeps you warm. I\'ve worn it with only a t-shirt several times and I still stay warm. The neck fastens tightly and the sleeves have an inner elastic part to keep the wind off your wrists. Also, the coat is long and has a draw string along the bottom to keep cold air out.The material isn\'t in the realm of Carhart, but it feels tough and kind of rubbery. It isn\'t water proof but I\'ve used it in plenty of sloppy snow storms and never gotten wet. The zippers are solid.I will warn you, the picture for the ""steel"" coat on Amazon is a little light. It seems much darker and kind of blue in real life, better than the pictures in my opinion.']"

I don\'t get cold very easily, I make an absurd amount of body heat, and if it isn\'t windy, a very light fleece, a hat, and some running gloves is all I need to wear at even the coldest months here in pittsburgh in my day to day life. This jacket doesn\'t have much insulation, but is wind (and water) proof. This means that I don\'t get hot while wearing my jacket and walk around, but also don\'t get chilled while waiting for the bus and a big gust of wind comes by. I hate wearing jackets usually because I have to take them off immediately after entering a building, or I will start to sweat. This also means that I end up having to awkwardly carry the jacket around in my arms. These two things are a big inconvenience to me, but with this jacket, I can wear the jacket indoors for a little while and not start to sweat. Big plus.I also love that this jacket is waterproof. I would give this jacket five stars even if it weren\'t just because of what I just wrote above, but having it be waterproof is a huge bonus. I walked out of work a couple days ago after having been indoors all day, and was surprised to find rain falling. It was only my second day with the jacket, but having it was super convenient. If i\'d have been in my standard fleece, I would have gotten soaked, but because I was in this, I stayed nice and dry.The Jacket has absolutely huge pockets in the front outside, and a nice also somewhat large chest pocket where I usually toss a pack of gum or something, but it\'s big enough to hold my iPhone 6+ plus more. I wish this jacket had pockets on the inside too, but that\'s not a super huge deal.For the fit: I\'m a pretty big dude, and I\'m tall. I\'m 280 and 6\'8"". I have a pretty hard time finding stuff that fits. Usually I get stuff in XL, but I didn\'t want short sleeves, so I got the XXL. The XXL is bigger around my stomach and chest then I would usually like, but the sleeves and jacket are the right length, and I like the jacket so much that I\'m okay with having it be a little loose.The outer material on this jacket is really cool too, it kinda feels like neoprene, but kinda not. It doesn\'t really look like it should be waterproof, but it most certainly is.If you are looking for a really awesome jacket that is wind proof, water proof, and has just a little bit of thermal retention, this is the jacket for you.']"

About 7 years ago I bought one and wore it for everything (work and casual) and washed it whenever it needed it which was often..  It lasted 3 years of hard use and I sort of felt like it should have lasted longer at the time.  I blamed it on the lighter fabric, but it was always warm, At the time I thought it should have rib knit on bottom of jacket to keep draft out.  It fit well and the hood is almost as warm as a hat.  The cuffs are right for work with very durable rib knit recessed under shell, with snap adjustments.  Heavy brass zipper. After it was worn through on sleeves and front pocket areas, I retired it to cover and insulate our booster pump.When I retired the Dickies I was given a Carharrt by my work which had a great design and 12 oz duck fabric, I thought it would be better and last longer.  It was size XL  where my dickies was large, and the Carharrt was fleece lined.  Within 6 months of what I considered careful light use, the Carharrt was worn through in places. First the arm just from putting my arm in window of truck  I patched it and babied it.  Kept using it but would take it off sooner than later while working, brush instead of washing when possible, keep it out of harms way.  It is 2+ years old and frayed on folds and patched ingeniously at cuffs, inside the pockets and there is some new wearthrough on the arms I don\'t think I can patch  The only thing that looks unworn is the back which should tell you something.  It hasn\'t seen a lot of sitting down.  It was never as warm as the dickies.  I trusted it more with barbed wire and brush work, but the material wore faster than the dickies for some reason and never as warm or comfortable.  I liked it though, and the pockets were great and shape/design was great.  I tried many other work jackets and military jackets, and finally concluded the Dickies TJ350 (this jacket) is best all in all and lasts as long as any of them (lasted me longer).  So I ordered one as season is winding down.  It fits exactly like the old one.  I wore it on a walk this morning at about 30 degrees before sun was out and it is warm.  Same as my old one, outer fabric feels light which used to worry me, and small draft at bottom when starting activity, but not as much as other jackets, and I know from ""longitudinal"" use under rigorous conditions, the lighter duck fabric lasts at least as long as heavier duck; longer in my experience.  It might be because it is more flexible and there is less abrasion when it moves?  The pockets are not as ""modern""  but it has everything you really need (pen loop and side zip front would be nice but oh well) and is has a light lining in the hand-warmer pockets.  I am going to buy a few backups of these as good deals come up and  be smarter about patching and using them.  They are great.  It is possible there is a tougher jacket out there, (maybe the walls Kevlar or the Carharrt cordura extremes?), but I have a new respect for this jacket. and it is a good feeling to go back to it.  The fit and warmth are identical to my old one. If you cant tell, I got a little obsessed with this, but when I have to do deal with cold and money was so tight, It was very important to me.  Heavyweight base layers and light warm mid layers are worth knowing about too, but this jacket is warm and comfortable all on its own.', 'This jacket was exactly what I expected', 'Fits great, and very comfortable and warm.']"

It's easy to just throw on over whatever I'm wearing -- whether just a t-shirt, dress shirt, or a sweater or sweatshirt.

It hangs well and isn't bulky, especially considering how warm it is.I had a very similar Dockers coat that I wore for about 7 years. The pattern was pretty much identical, but the shell on that coat was a normal fabric. The soft shell on this coat makes it noticeably warmer than the previous coat -- almost too warm for Seattle winters.My only complaint is that the zipper needs to be improved. The zipper failed on the first one I bought and Amazon replaced it. The zipper is a little finicky on the second one but seems to be holding up OK.

The interior sleeve cuffs are right at the base of my palm, and don’t ride up my arm when moving and lifting objects. The Full Swing features are nice and gives me a great fit doing any movement. I live in Iowa and the wind breaking ability of this jacket on cold/windy days is impressive. I also appreciate the pocket locations and pocket sizes.My only two minor complaints after 3 weeks of use are 1) the ribbed waist cuff is a little tight on my waist but I’m hoping it will stretch out a little bit over time. I usually just wear it unzipped when I’m running errands on 30-40 degree days. 2) The felt lining and construction of the shoulders is comfortable BUT it seems to “snag” my shirt sleeves when putting on the jacket each time, which bunches up my shirt sleeves at the shoulder. I usually have to reach across with my other hand and pull my sleeve back down my upper arm on both sides.Overall, I love the jacket and I wear it often when temps are below 45 in Iowa.

I have worn this jacket in high wind situations, snow, sleet, and plain old cold days. Absolutely my favorite of all the Carhartt jackets I have ever owned. The most comfortable and the one that allows me to move and groove with absolutely no restrictions.I needed a new jacket that was warm, could withstand working out with an axe or sledgehammer, kettlebell etc. and also feel comfortable. Also had to be tough enough to withstand crawling, rolling, sitting by a campfire, rolled up as a pillow, and look good. This Full Swing Jac covers all those bases. I have worn it while working out with my kettlebell in cold weather (20 to 38 degrees), bushwacking through heavy brush, chopping wood, and all the rest. One of my favorite aspects is that the sleeves never ride up on my arms. The cut keeps the cuffs right at my wrists all the time. The zipper moves easily. It was comfortable to wear right out of the package. I stay dry in a moderate rain for about an hour. This is now one of my favorite jackets.']"

jacket,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61sa6K8NsnS.__AC_SY445_SX342_QL70_ML2_.jpg,"[""I bought this for a marathon race because just a few days before the race, the forecast was 100% chance of rain. First of all, I'm 6' tall and 180lb. I usually wear medium size jacket, only occasionally I would need a large. I debated for a long time what size to get because most of the answered questions would suggest a large for my build. Plus, the large size is somehow a whopping $40 cheaper than the medium.I went with my gut feeling and ordered a medium size because I don't want a very loose jacket for running. Once I got the jacket and tried it on, it fit me perfectly. However, the style of the jacket does not look like the male model picture on the Amazon page. (See my photo as reference) The actual jacket fits loose and the model either has it one size smaller or the jacket is pinned on the back for photography effect.Anyway, the jacket itself is quite good. It is 100% waterproof and it's very light. Though I don't find it's breathable like it claimed in the product description. I wore this on the marathon. While it was raining heavily, the jacket kept my dry the whole run. Though my body was quite sweaty from the running. The vents under the armpits helped a bit. After the race when I stopped running, I immediately felt very cold. So don't count on this jacket to keep you warm."", 'If you need a lightweight windbreaker/raincoat...this fits the ticket.  Folds to about the size a box of kitchen matches.', 'I was wary about buying a Columbia product from Amazon as I noticed quite a few reviews that mentioned fake products. I took a. Hence and was relieved to get the real deal.Jacket is just as advertised. I’d suggest wearing a long sleeve shirt with it as the liner material isn’t the most comfortable. If you’re a heavy sweater, you might not enjoy this jacket as it may cause you to sweat a lot.Definitely water resistant, but I haven’t had a chance to stand outside in a downpour yet.Comfortable, but not aesthetically pleasing (imo).All in all, solid product for a decent price.4/5 because I’m not a fan of the liner material.', 'I bought this to replace an older rain jacket by Columbia. The older version has started to peel and under a sustained tropical downpour it leaks. Lots of reasons a coating can fail, wear and tear, folds and creases and extreme temperatures. Suffice to say they don\'t last forever and I got at least seven years out of it. This jacket features most of the features of my old one; breathable membrane coating, fully seam sealed and pit zips. It also has drawstrings on the waist and hood. There\'s Velcro on the cuffs and on the hood (to adjust the brim). Missing features were buttons on top of the front zippers and a way to stow the hood away. The buttons may be redundant as the zips are ""waterproof"". No, not really. Some water does get through hence why I miss having an extra flap of material over the zipper. Another issue I noticed is the zippers (all of them) get caught way too easily causing me to fumble way too much. I didn\'t have this issue with my older one. The absence of stowage for the hood is another annoyance. I sometimes wear my jacket as a hardshell when gets a bit chilly. I fish a lot and having the hood flap around in the breeze is downright annoying. Removing these features resulted in a lighter product at the cost of practical usability. Great if you are one of those ultralight types but I\'d prefer a more useful jacket. Would I buy one again? Unlikely, I hate the zippers too much. As a reference... I bought this in small, and it fits me well. I\'m 1.69m, 66kg. Male, lean built.', 'I purchased this jacket for a trip to London and Paris my wife and I were taking. This jacket worked well for my needs. 1. Water proof. 2. Use as a light wind breaker. 3. Easy to pack.During the 2 week trip it rained only once and the jacket did what it should do, kept me dry. I put it to a good test today walking the dog, water did not penetrate. This jacket is fine if it is not humid, even with the arm pit vents open, I would have sweated and been wet from that. I feel it is very import to have vents. It just makes sense, the air need to vent out somewhere. I also liked the Velcro/stretch wrists. This is a plus, it may not seem like much, but its nice to be able to remove the jacket without having to undo the Velcro. Another feature I liked with the hood, it has an adjustable strap which will keep the hood from going down too far over your head. You can stuff this in a pack or suite case, or stuff it into its pocket. I gave it 4 stars simply because if you stuff it into the pocket and zip it closed the pull on the zipper does not travel to the outside of the zipper and I would go with the next size up, especially if you at the upper limit of your size.  These are my only complaints. I also have not had it very long to give feedback on a long term use.']"

Most of the ultra-expensive coats and jackets that Canada Goose sells use 650 dfp down. Things have changed and the high end is much higher now, but 650 dfp is still good.

If it is wet out, I'll wear this jacket under a waterproof shell. The coldest weather, and I combine the three layers: Fleece hoody, down sweater, gore-tex shell. That can take me down to the 0º F easily. I'll see if I can use that combo even lower this January. It just hasn't gotten that cold yet.Workmanship is fine. Remember this is a $59 dollar jacket. I found one hanging thread I cut off. It wasn't a loose thread, just extra. The first few days, a few of the very tiny down feathers came out near some seems. I have had this with every down jacket I have owned. The very smallest feathers fit through the larger sew holes. It happens, but it doesn't really leak down.To sum it up, it is worth the price charged here on Amazon. You can get jackets with more feartures, but they cost more. You can get jackets with better down, or better fabrics but you won't get them for $59.Jackets like the Montbell Alpine Lite, REI Magma 850 2.0, or Patagonia down sweater have more features, better fabric and better down. They retail for $209 to $229. You'll see extra features like zipper storm flaps, zippered chest pockets, fleece lined collars, water resistant down and more on these other jackets. Features that are not present on this jacket. They also cost from $140 to $170 more than this jacket does.This is a great bargain for the price, it can be a really good part of any layered winter system, and you can buy 3 or 4 of these for the price of a high end brand name lite down jacket.I've added pictures of the one loose thread, and one of the very small feathers that came out (the feather is so small it is hard to see).I've added pictures of how I layer the jacket with the fleece and the outer shell when needed.This is a good deal, has responsibly sourced down and is pretty well made.

For example the Cuffs are rolled with material on the inside and double stitched. This coat is very durable. Zippers are a little above average. Size is 100% true.

I was blown away by how much more robust the fabric, lining, and construction are and the perceived value compared to those high-tech garments that cost twice what this does. Water resistance is on-par with a full-on waterproof rain jacket without the claminess. If I lived somewhere it rains a lot I\'d have ordered with the hood, but for California weather this one is a winner. Ski-able, take it out on the ocean fishing or sailing in confidence, hang Christmas lights in the rain - whatever.The ONE and ONLY characteristic I noticed is how ""audible"" the fabric is -- this isn\'t a quiet softshell by any means, so if you\'re looking for something  really soft and quiet there are probably better choices.

Turns out, this is an equally nice and well-made product, very solid quality overall, and thus a good value.I may have screwed up a little by ordering an XL, assuming the extra size would be good for wearing over bulkier winter clothes. I can normally wear a large in most things but have become accustomed to some of the imported garments running small and ordering up a size to allow for that. This jacket runs very true to American sizing, and a Large probably would have been more than adequate; the XL is a bit big. For reference, I wear a 45 chest, 17 neck, and 35-36 sleeve length in dress shirts or sport coats, and am 6\'3"" tall and about 190 lbs.So anyway, for me this jacket fits a bit looser/bulkier than I would have preferred, but it\'s okay, and the sleeve length is perfect. The lower hem breaks just an inch or two below my belt, which means it won\'t gap and let in cold air when I move around or get in and out of my car. In addition, there are a couple of tabs on the waistband that allow you to adjust it, so I was able to take it in a notch with those.Oddly, the sleeve cuffs also have snaps on them but there is only one on each, so no adjustment of the rather large cuffs is possible. Sort of makes me wonder why they bothered with a snap closure at all... The cuffs could stand to be smaller, but the wide cuffs will fit down easily over the tops of gloves to avoid gaps or hangups there as well.  The pockets are well-placed and functional.The faded denim is top-notch, the sherpa lining is plush and soft, and everything is well and neatly stitched. We haven\'t had any real cold weather yet, but this feels like it will be a very warm and comfortable jacket when we do. I love the look of denim jackets, but my only other one, which is unlined, absolutely does not provide much warmth.

My fiance\' wanted to buy me one for my birthday a few months ago while it was still cold here inTexas, but we couldn\'t find one in my size in the stores at the time so she got me something else. A few weeks ago, I received an email from amazon about a sale on the same jacket I was interested in and it was 30% off retail price. As usual, I did my homework and looked at reviews extensively as well as other jacket styles. I almost went with a lighter weight jacket, but glad I didn\'t, as I have several ligh weight jackets already. The reviews seemed to all suggest the jacket runs large so, I ordered a medium as I am 5\'11"" 170 lbs. and normally a large in jackets. I\'m glad I did because the medium fits near perfectly. I\'m sure the large would be way too bulky on me. If I fully extend my arms over my head, the jacket does expose my stomach a bit and the cuffs do ride up my wrists slightly, however this is to be expected and happens with my other, large sized jackets as well. I\'m sure that in extreme cold climates, you would want to go for your normal size so the jacket could be worn over multiple layers, but for me in Texas, I feel this jacket will keep my warm with only a single layer underneath on the coldest of days.Carhartt products are no longer made in the USA, however the fabric used does still come from US providers. The construction seems very sturdy. The jacket is a bit stiff, but after one wash, it is a bit more loose. I was looking for a rugged jacket and this fits the bill. I expect this jacket will hold up through the roughest situations and last many years. I love the quilted lining, it is very comfortable. The arms are quilted as well, but not with flannel like the rest of the jacket. This is designed to let you get your arms through even while wearing a long sleeve shirt underneath. The inner pockets are a great feature and while the outer pockets aren\'t lined, they are spacious and comfortable enough for hands. The zipper is very rugged and takes a little persuasion sometimes, as expected from a heavy-duty zipper. The hood is spacious and comfortable. It does add some bulk just behind the neck, but I\'d rather have it there if needed than not. It does have pull strings to fit more snugly if needed. The arms and waist have elastic bands to keep out any drafts when it is windy and they are just as heavy-duty as the rest of the jacket.Overall, I am very satisfied with this jacket. I haven\'t worn it besides trying it on a few times yet, but I don\'t imagine I\'ll change my mind when I do.']"

About 7 years ago I bought one and wore it for everything (work and casual) and washed it whenever it needed it which was often..  It lasted 3 years of hard use and I sort of felt like it should have lasted longer at the time.  I blamed it on the lighter fabric, but it was always warm, At the time I thought it should have rib knit on bottom of jacket to keep draft out.  It fit well and the hood is almost as warm as a hat.  The cuffs are right for work with very durable rib knit recessed under shell, with snap adjustments.  Heavy brass zipper. After it was worn through on sleeves and front pocket areas, I retired it to cover and insulate our booster pump.When I retired the Dickies I was given a Carharrt by my work which had a great design and 12 oz duck fabric, I thought it would be better and last longer.  It was size XL  where my dickies was large, and the Carharrt was fleece lined.  Within 6 months of what I considered careful light use, the Carharrt was worn through in places. First the arm just from putting my arm in window of truck  I patched it and babied it.  Kept using it but would take it off sooner than later while working, brush instead of washing when possible, keep it out of harms way.  It is 2+ years old and frayed on folds and patched ingeniously at cuffs, inside the pockets and there is some new wearthrough on the arms I don\'t think I can patch  The only thing that looks unworn is the back which should tell you something.  It hasn\'t seen a lot of sitting down.  It was never as warm as the dickies.  I trusted it more with barbed wire and brush work, but the material wore faster than the dickies for some reason and never as warm or comfortable.  I liked it though, and the pockets were great and shape/design was great.  I tried many other work jackets and military jackets, and finally concluded the Dickies TJ350 (this jacket) is best all in all and lasts as long as any of them (lasted me longer).  So I ordered one as season is winding down.  It fits exactly like the old one.  I wore it on a walk this morning at about 30 degrees before sun was out and it is warm.  Same as my old one, outer fabric feels light which used to worry me, and small draft at bottom when starting activity, but not as much as other jackets, and I know from ""longitudinal"" use under rigorous conditions, the lighter duck fabric lasts at least as long as heavier duck; longer in my experience.  It might be because it is more flexible and there is less abrasion when it moves?  The pockets are not as ""modern""  but it has everything you really need (pen loop and side zip front would be nice but oh well) and is has a light lining in the hand-warmer pockets.  I am going to buy a few backups of these as good deals come up and  be smarter about patching and using them.  They are great.  It is possible there is a tougher jacket out there, (maybe the walls Kevlar or the Carharrt cordura extremes?), but I have a new respect for this jacket. and it is a good feeling to go back to it.  The fit and warmth are identical to my old one. If you cant tell, I got a little obsessed with this, but when I have to do deal with cold and money was so tight, It was very important to me.  Heavyweight base layers and light warm mid layers are worth knowing about too, but this jacket is warm and comfortable all on its own.', 'This jacket was exactly what I expected', 'Fits great, and very comfortable and warm.']"

I like to keep a couple and they were a good price on Prime Day, so I ordered red and black ones. And I was blown away. The colors and style are fantastic. The lining of the hood and metal-tipped draw string pulls are nice touches.The powerblend fleece is the main reason I got them since the sweat pants have become my favorites. I don't know if it's pre-washed but they don't seem to shrink. It's much softer and more comfortable than pure polyester.Normally I can find something I don't like about any product, but these might honestly be perfect. I'm not usually a big fan of big logos, but the Champion logo is very well done.  They deserve to have their logo in big letters if they're going to make a hoodie this good.I've since bought a royal blue pullover and now a black reverse weave, full zip hoodie. It seems like so many brands have been getting worse lately but Champion is just nailing it. These pullovers are so warm it's the first thing I reach for when I'm cold.

I will revisit after a little break in period.FITI would definitely suggest ordering your TRUE size with this jacket.  So, if you wear size M t-shirts, get a M size in this.  This torso of the jacket is NOT excessively baggy, and the waist will hit your waist.  If you are tall, definitely order a tall size.  I\'m pretty short for a man (5\'9"") and a M comes right to my belt line.  Arms are bit on the baggy/full side.FINISHThe Detroit Jacket is intended to be rugged work wear, so it\'s pretty basic and classic in style.  I ordered in black, and the black color is very deep and dark.  Main fabric is very heavy duck canvas, seems very durable.  The jacket is initially VERY stiff, and will require a breaking in period.  The interior is lined with a thick black, grey, and red striped blanket material, and is a nice detail.  Collar is soft corduroy, looks nice.  Interior patch by collar shows ""MADE IN THE USA.""  Zippers are YKK zips.  Interior zipper is black, both exterior zippers and tracks are brass colored.  Main zip features Carhartt logo.  NOTE: despite the title, this jacket is NOT a weathered model.UTILITYThis jacket seems tough and durable, with very thick cotton duck fabric making up the bulk of it.  Back of collar features silver colored snaps to attach a (sold separately) compatible hood.  Inside right of jacket features a zipper pocket that easily accommodates a large cellphone.  Outside left breast pocket is also zippered, but is quite a bit smaller, and will fit something roughly the size of a deck of cards.  Hip pockets are angled and feature no sort of closure, probably better suited for keeping your hands warm or stowing gloves or small tools.COMFORTAs previously mentioned it is very stiff, at least initially.  The lining is thick and insulating, so I feel comfortable wearing this jacket all through Fall and early or mild Winter days.  The cuffs are snap adjustable, as are the sides of the waist.  Back shoulder area where sleeves meet torso is gusseted, to allow full range of motion for both arms with no binding.  Sleeves are generous, and not fitted closely.  I feel the need to reiterate: the jacket is very stiff at first.OVERALLThe Detroit jacket is much warmer than it seems.  It is made in the USA with USA and imported materials.  The jacket is thick and seemingly  durable, and seems built to last.  It is, however, quite stiff initially and hopefully will break in and become more comfortable after a bit of wear.

It was well abused when I got it and it lasted another 10 winters!!  Flash forward and I bought another in Black size large.  I wear a large in darn near everything and this one fit exactly as expected.  The quality is top notch.  The fabric is thick and stiff when new, after a month of wear, its still pretty stiff, which is ok as it softens over time and wears like tree bark.  Mine has the blanket inner liner in the torso and nylon quilt in the sleeves.  The vintage jacket had blanket lining throughout.  Time will tell if the sleeve liner wears out faster than the blanket sleeves of old.  It was made in the US of US and imported sourced parts, whatever that means.Now to the fit.  Many reviews have mentioned the short waist on this jacket. I would have to think it is for one reason.....tool belts.  That is why I buy the Detroit style.  When you work outside and wear a tool belt, a long waisted coat sucks (my opinion) because it either bunches up on top of your tool rigs or covers them.  Some workers will use suspenders over a long waisted coat, but that severely restricts movement.  I use a single pouch, no suspenders and I like how this coat rides over the tool deployment zone.  If I did use suspension rigs, I would wear it under this jacket.  Also driving a vehicle benefits from the short waist.  You don't sit on the coat tail.  So be advised, this is a shorter waist jacket.  Great for tool belts, driving and accessing pants pockets, or if you just want a more trim looking fit."", ""I hope it's cold enough at the Kieth Urban concert at the Choctaw Casino to wear it. I have had a blanket lined chore coat for 3 decades along with a hooded jacket. I've been wanting a Detroit for almost as long & finally treated myself.  I'm a Texas boy. I've got a parka that I've worn 20 times in 20 years. Too much coat for down here. The Carhartt's usually come out of the closet in October & get dry cleaned in April. This one was bought to be a dress coat. Kind of a style statement in SE Texas. Show up at a formal with a tie in a Carhartt & everybody backs up 4 feet and keeps an eye on you.

Working very well. The best part about this jacket is that it has several pockets including hand pockets that make your personal inventory of miniature, small items to be placed and makes it versatile for your personal security. Also, including the reflectors. Moreover, I love that it has an detachable, zipping hood that you can adjust the tension of it depending on what conditions you are facing and whether or not you need the hood. The hood also can be enclosed using straps and is foldable to make it less bulk. In relation to the bottom section of the jacket, you can adjust the tension there as well by the tensioner strings located at the bottom, hidden from the inside of the jacket; as you tighten the tension, the tension at the bottom of the jacket becomes more slim and makes the jacket get closer to your body for extra warmth. Despite being fairly lightweight as it has some weight put into it, I will give this weight a pass.The only thing I encountered that was wrong with the jacket is that one of the front snap buttons came apart as I was unbuttoning it; the knit wasn't strong enough to secure the button, but that was only the lower button in the front.Ultimately, the last thing I despise about the jacket is that it's not equipped with zippers for the front side hand pockets. I have lost one of my gloves because the pockets weren't deep enough and was expecting that all the pockets would have zippers. I believe this is the most crucial flaw about this tundra jacket in my opinion.Overall, this jacket is great! I definitely recommend getting this jacket especially when *needing one with extra pockets, *keeping your body temperature warm, and *adjusting the mass of the jacket at your most comfortable desire. Price ranges and quality vary, but it's definitely worth every single penny."", ""I love how many pockets this jacket has (ten total). It looks very sharp and is very comfortable.The only negative is the sleeves. There's a cuff at the end of the inside of the sleeve that always pushes out when I put it on, and extends too far. So putting the jacket on takes a little dexterity to deal with the cuffs.Otherwise, I love it. It's the third one I've purchased as I've gone from a 3X to 2X to XL."", 'Bought this for my son 6’2 185 pounds-  tall and fit.

The first one was a little large but I wore it for 3 winters up in Wisconsin. The only thing bad was a button fell off. Last year I snagged it on a piece of metal and a seam tore, but that would have happened to any coat. After that I got a medium and it fits better. (I\'m 5 10, average build)This coat is thin (not puffy), yet feels heavy. It keeps the wind out and keeps you warm. I\'ve worn it with only a t-shirt several times and I still stay warm. The neck fastens tightly and the sleeves have an inner elastic part to keep the wind off your wrists. Also, the coat is long and has a draw string along the bottom to keep cold air out.The material isn\'t in the realm of Carhart, but it feels tough and kind of rubbery. It isn\'t water proof but I\'ve used it in plenty of sloppy snow storms and never gotten wet. The zippers are solid.I will warn you, the picture for the ""steel"" coat on Amazon is a little light. It seems much darker and kind of blue in real life, better than the pictures in my opinion.']"

I have an unlined Carhartt jacket and I like this much more than my Carhartt. The Carhartt is so bulky and stiff it's very uncomfortable and I don't wear it much. This one, though big, is not really bulky and not stiff at all. I only gave 4 stars due to some sizing issues. I am a female and I usually wear a 2x but I ordered a 3x bc I wanted this to be loose. It is not very loose and I am glad I went up a size.  It is very tight around my hips when zipped. The sleeves however are really loose. They fall down over my hands even when snapped on the tightest snap, and I have large hands. However, it is so comfortable I don't really care about the sizing issues much.

Comments about sleeve length must be from non-bikers. While riding they’re right where they should be…', 'I will start by saying that at first i bough this jacket in size Small, following diferent reviews mentioning that it runs large, and it probably does but that depends on your physique. I\'m 1.70 m (5\'5) tall and 75 kg (165 lb). I have always bought size in mediums but this time i chose first small.  I would say small size fits me well, kind of fitted, but unless i will stay just standing, without moving, i started to fell it not so good, when i try to drive my car or try to move my arms i feel very restrianed. So i decided to sell it to a relative younger and go for the medium. At first was a little bit concerned  about size M will make a big difference and i would start having the opposite issue, a baggy jacket.For my surprise, when i received the M jacket, it fit me very well, the difrerence with the small was just enough to eliminate all the issues i had at first with the Small one.I would say overall, the Medium increases 1"" inch to shoulders/chest/waist, and length from shoulder to waist; as for the arms length i would size half inch is added, and that\'s good because this jacket has kind of large arms, which i noticed even on the small one, but i think this is on purpose, since this jacket style is kind of motorcycle jacket, so when you extend your arms it gives you enough to avoid expose your forearms.So in the end, medium will fits you like a globe if you\'re around 1.65 to 1.75 m tall and, depending of how you like the fit, from 70 to 80 kg. Small size i would say its more for people around 1.55 to 1.65 m and 60 to 70 kg. This jacket has some kind of fitted style, so take this in consideration if you have a big belly. it\'s not a baggy cut.Now, talking about the quality...it\'s great!!Even is not real leather, the look of this jacket is very nice, it doesn\'t look like plastic as i have seen on other jackets on local stores (hello Levi\'s, Merona and Arizona). Faux leather is thick and it feels like leather to the touch, jacket is ""heavy"" and by saying this im not complaining, im just saying that this is a good feature. Color is very nice, is some antique/rustic brown, not a solid color. I have received many complaints about it in general.Jacket has internal cloth liner, that makes this jacket more warm, also it has internal chest pockets on both sides, so you have additional room for carry your phone or any item. Also, as you can see on the pictures this jacket features a detachable hood that you can use it whenever you want.Finally:Pros: Color, material, cut, look,priceCons: This is just something i would like, not something bad but i would prefer the hat to be black color instead of grey.The pictures i\'m posting are from the Medium size. I didn\'t have chance to take pictures to the small one. I hope these help you to get your size at first time.

I was getting tired of cinching down my belt in order to keep my pants up without ""saggy butt syndrome"" or feeling like I was being choked to death at the waist when I sat down.So, ideally I wanted a pant that was lightweight, cool to wear in the heat, with lots of give in the waist, seat & inseam. I also was looking for a pair that did double-duty as a casual, everyday pair that was semi-dressy/business casual.Voila - these pants of hit on all cylinders.  I worked for 30 years in the IT industry where ""business casual"" was the standard dress code. These are an ideal replacement for the traditional ""khakis"".The best part of these, hands down is their COMFORT.  Typically when I was working, the first thing I did when I got home was to get out of my suit or business casual clothes and put on a well-worn pair of jeans.  These are WAY more comfortable than any pair of jeans.No that I\'m retired, my typical ""around-the-house"" casual attire is a pair of jeans, pajama bottoms, or lounging pants.These Lees are so comfortable that I could see myself wearing them all day.Fabric - the fabric on these is different than anything I\'ve ever worn.  Heavier than a nylon, lighter than a cotton.  To the touch the fabric has a bit of a velvety feel.NEGATIVESThe only real negative I can think of is that they seem to tend to pick up a little lint.  Not real bad, but just something my wife noticed.Bear in mind that I didn\'t wash them before I wore them the first time, so after first wash, this may change.The only other thing is that after being a jeans guy my whole life, I think it\'s going to take me a little time of wearing these before I feel like they will replace my jeans.', ""I wear these pants to work.

Talla muy bien.', 'Great price, great quality, great fit.', 'I retired several khaki slacks in my work wardrobe recently, so I was looking for options. I bought some Dockers Straight Fit no iron and found them to be good quality, but the a little pricey. plus the Dockers do not come in the odd in between waist sizes. The Izod American Chino does come in a 31 waist, which works better for me now that I have lost a bit of weight and a 32 feels too loose. I thought the price for these Izods was very reasonable, but was unsure what kind of quality or fit I would get. I ordered the British Khaki and the Navy to find out if they would work on me.Fit: Definitely more of a contemporary fit compared to some of my older fuller cut pants from other brands. It\'s advertised as ""straight fit"", and I would say more closely fitted than the Dockers straight fit pants. The leg hole at the cuff is noticeably smaller than on the Dockers for a more tailored look, but without being too slim. I could squat down or kneel in my Dockers without hesitation. With the Izods on I am a more careful because I feel it\'s tighter in the thigh and seat. I could see how you might cause a blow out by suddenly contorting yourself. But probably true of any no-stretch clothing that fits more closely. Totally comfortable for normal sitting and walking though.Fabric: Seems the equivalent of what most makers are offering in their no iron khakis as far as weight and feel. Maybe a very slight sheen to the fabric which I don\'t mind at all. I tossed them in the washing machine and then ran them through the dryer at the wrinkle free cotton setting. Pants emerged without wrinkles. The key is to not put your wrinkle free stuff in a dryer packed with other clothing. Leave a lot of room in the machine so the other stuff doesn\'t crush and wrinkle the pants, and then remove immediately when dry and put on a hanger. Little or no shrinkage detected. The after wash fit seemed equivalent to the pre-wash fit. BTW, you can remove the annoying IZOD label by CAREFULLY picking at the row of stitching on the label surface with a sharp Xacto knife. Obviously this will void any possibility of a return. Do this before you wash the pants too many times, otherwise the fabric that was under the label will look different. The crease in the pant legs that was evident when they arrived in the packaging vanished after washing. Dockers seem to hold their crease even after wash. These IZODs will emerge from the wash as true flat front chinos. Fine by me. But if you\'re determined to have creases, then youneed to iron them back in.If they hold up well, I will likely order some more. They seem to be a great value. I sit at a computer most of the workday, so these pants should work out great for business casual wear. But if I was in a more physically active job, then I would think something from Dickies or Carhartt might be more appropriate for pure durability.']"

Typical slim fits are too tight on my thighs and loose around the ankles, but regular fits are too loose everywhere. These are one of the first I’ve found that fit me perfectly. They have a slight taper, which keeps the fit all the way down to the ankles, but it’s not so extreme that there’s no room to move. I get 32x33’s. I now have 3 pairs in different colors.They work well with office attire and out on the golf course. They blend casual with professional very well. I especially like that they are wrinkle-resistant, so I don’t have to do anything special to keep them smooth. There is also a gel material in the waistband which keeps shirts tucked, which is a nice feature.I have only two main issues with them. First, they are lint magnets. They will attract lint from every which direction, even when using dryer cloths. I have a lint roller in my office which helps. Second, the material is a little noisy and stuffy. It’s expected of polyester, but it’s not the smooth weave—it’s the itchy, stuffy type of polyester.

My quads are on the muscular side, and I actually had to size up to make my upper legs fit. I originally ordered a 29"" waist, but had to go to 30"".

Something I could wear to the office on these 90+ degree days here along the Gulf Coast.

I finally found exactly what I was looking for: cool, comfortable linen blend pants that are appropriate for work and pair well with a sportcoat or blazer, and which are not priced like a new suit.Fit: slightly tailored but without being tight. I\'ve got somewhat thick thighs for my waist size, which means I often try on pants that fit beautifully as long as I remain standing and then become uncomfortably tight around the quads the moment I sit down.

The natural pair is a fairly light color, darker than off-white, but not by much, and certainly lighter than tan. Think unbleached paper cone coffee filter. The coloring has a little bit of natural variation. The navy pair, however, has an even and consistent color throughout that tends to mask the texture of the fabric unless seen up close, so the pants aren\'t obviously linen when seen from more than a few feet away.Care: Since these are dress pants, you won\'t want to go with the crumpled look of casual linen beach wear. And that means you do have to iron them a bit as they\'ll come out of the dryer looking a little shriveled on the legs.

A 33"" waist in this pant fits perfectly. It just stretches slightly without giving the appearance of 50 pounds of flour in a 30 lb sack, if you know what I mean.  They have a handsome, tailored drape down the leg, and strike a perfect balance of not too tight, not too loose, just right, said Goldilocks.', 'I was instantly rather astonished at the feel of the material and the very modern cut of these slacks. My fears that they would be made of a rough material were dashed immediately upon shimmering them in the light as I felt the texture of the smooth cloth.The pants material is also thin and light.After putting them on the first issue presented...which I must be fair, is more an issue of me than the slacks. See, I\'ve gained a good 15 lbs in the last year and for me weight tends to live ...dare I say thrive right on my thunderous thighs, plus these are the slim fit...so it was no surprise to me that this is where the slacks were the most snug...dare I say tight. That said, giving them the flex test revealed that they do have quite a great amount of flex and I imagine that after a few wears they\'ll be supple enough so that the initial tightness in the thigh abates (particularly as I am engaged on a weight loss program through the end of the year to slim my thighs naturally).That said, I super love the look and feel of these pants when worn....the 32 length is just slightly longer than I\'d expect (they form a hard break at the shoe line) but it\'s easy to have them hemmed up to a light break (my preferred look).I kept thinking ""Did I pay $20 or 35$ for these???? Either price seems way low compared to similar quality slacks I\'ve seen on sale for $100.""I don\'t know how Amazon and Haggar is doing it (I do note that the zippers are pretty cheap plastic zippers...but one can get these replaced for proper metal zippers at a tailor for not much at all) but I plan on buying a few more, this time I\'ll size up to 34 x 32 to see if the additional waist size provides a bit more room through my thighs.Update:I took delivery of the 34 x 32 and these have the perfect amount of room in the thigh area right out the pack...but since I already gave it 5 stars nothing to do here. ;)']"

I hope that Fjallraven becomes better known in the United States so we can see more of their products available here.SIZINGI am 5\'7"" 140 lbs. and my true waist measurement is around 29"". I received the Size 44 which is advertised as a US 28. That is inaccurate. The size 44 is really a 30x32. The inseam measures 32"" exactly. I wish there were more sizing options particularly for the inseam length but this is the shortest Fjallraven makes them available it seems. I shortened the inseam with a Euro Hem (aka Tricky Hem) so I could keep the original hems & their adjustable ankle straps. Note: According to Fjallraven\'s sizing guide the regular inseam length of a size 44 is 32"". The long version has a 34"" inseam. To get a shorter inseam length you would have to order a size 42. Size 42 has a 31"" inseam length for regular but, of course, it would have a smaller waist as well.MATERIALThe G-1000 material is similar to tactical pants fabric, light yet very sturdy though the G-1000 is a bit stiffer & more rugged than my Tru-Spec tac pants. They are relatively quiet pants with a slight swish sound if your legs rub. Water beads up & rolls off them nicely. I haven\'t gotten them soaked but I spot cleaned them & it dried very quickly. I prefer this material over the delicate nylon or thin polyester that typical hiking pants are made of.FITThese pants are a slim fit but give good room for movement. The knee areas are slightly pre-curved and allow easier movement. I can lunge, high-step & kneel wearing 2 base layers underneath: 1 light merino wool & 1 thick fleece. Each of my upper legs is 20"" around & with the base layers there is still comfort room in the thigh area.CONSTRUCTIONThere are no back pockets but instead there are several clever cargo pockets of varying size around the upper legs. However, because of the slim fit of these pants the options of what you can store in them are limited. They are not baggy so you cannot stuff the pockets with anything bulky. The hems have adjustable ankle straps built in with snap enclosures so you can tighten the bottoms around your boots to keep bugs/debris out. The hand-warmer pockets are a bit tight. In order to keep the fit of the pants slim & practical they went with a snug fit for the slashed hand pockets. There is extra fabric reinforcement on the knees/shins and on the rear-end of the pants. Stitching is well done and sturdy but I haven\'t slid down any hills yet to test it out. The pants are made in Vietnam, not Sweden, but Fjallraven has a legendary reputation so I have faith in their quality control.COLORI chose the Tarmac/Dark Olive color selection. The color \'Tarmac\' is a light olive drab with a slight hint of gray. Very earthy. I tend to favor khaki-colored pants to spot ticks easier but the tarmac color is light enough. The Dark Olive reinforcement areas give a nice, brownish contrast.ORDERINGI\'m glad Backcountry.com carries the Fjallraven brand. Hopefully they can expand on the Fjallraven products they carry. They arrived quickly with no issues.Overall a fantastic pair of trekking pants. They are very rugged & durable. I can go trailblazing without fear of my pants tearing on a snag. And as a slim guy these are the first hiking pants that actually fit well. Plus, they have a really cool look!', 'I am 6\' and about 165 pounds - I purchased Euro 46 or US 30""-31"" in regular length. Figure out your waist size AND the length. Fjällräven makes short, regular and long. Also - Vidda pro pants come vented and regular. Vented has a stretch material crotch and zippers on both outer thighs for ventilation. Pro regular does not and has a slightly different pocket configuration. Make sure you know which one you are ordering.I wear them any day of the week - not just hiking. They are also excellent for travel day. Keeps your wallet, passport and boarding pass in the front under a snap-close pocket for easy access through security and for boarding. In addition, they are more difficult for a pickpocket to get through in the big cities. These pants also have boot hooks at the bottom for serious terrain and you can close them around your boots at the cuffs. Again, top quality and will not disappoint. Don\'t waste your time or money on cheap Chinese junk. If you are serious, these are worth the money. These are top quality pants and will not disappoint.', ""Love these trousers. Great pockets, built to last, very clever retractable straps to tighten the bottom of the legs. The laces hooks are useful, and the pockets very well though out.

Forget about Iphone 12 Max, Galaxy A71 or S22, you know, the bigger phones, a quarter of a phone will stick out of the pocket, making you live in fear that you will lose it and, also, and quite obviously, making it very enticing for pickpocketers. Granted, dressing pants or even these pants will never be as secure as jeans, but even pants with side pockets could be fine if the pockets are made deep enough. These ones not. Don\'t they see that they are made for men, and we usually don\'t carry purses so we need to stick at least wallet, phone and keys inside. Why can\'t they on Earth make the pockets a couple of inches deeper? Does it need rocket science? Just because of that, they are not only uncomfortable, but dangerous: the odds of dropping something are ENORMOUS.Also, and secondly, the inner fabric of the pockets of this is as thin as smoking paper, so what happens is that the phone is always dialing when the screen touches your thigh, because it wakes the screen.

They are not nearly as hot as I thought they would be, due to the ventilated fabric in the crotch and inner thigh, and the side vents.  I got them to use for hunting where I will be off trail in brush, which is right around the corner.  These pants seem like they will work well for this purpose.  Mobility is great, and I love all the features.  The cinching cuffs and the hook that attaches to boot laces will help to keep brush and grass out of the legs of the pants, pretty much taking the place of gaiters.  The ability to wax the lower legs and butt will be great for hiking and sitting in wet grass.  These could even function well as ski pants with a base layer.  Plus, they look great.  Only cons are that there is no back pocket for a wallet, and there is a little too much fabric in the lower leg, which can cause a swishing sound when rubbing while walking.

While in the bag these pants look like the real deal, complete with the embroidered logo and tags. Upon removal, though, they give off a malodorous chemical scent (imagine plastic mixed with dye). The good news is this does fade after letting them air out for about a day (or you could just wash them right away). Before first wash and wear, these do not seem to be made of 100% cotton. The feel of the fabric, excluding the waist band, is a bit stiff and somewhat synthetic. My conclusion is either the cotton is mercerized (chemically treated to avoid stretching and to both accept and retain dye better) or it is some kind of cotton/cheap polyester blend.

Something I could wear to the office on these 90+ degree days here along the Gulf Coast. And every year I would get frustrated and give up after sifting through an abundance of baggy, drawstring-waisted, beach pants. I might find one or two offerings from some high end brands, but at eye-watering prices.Not this year, though. I finally found exactly what I was looking for: cool, comfortable linen blend pants that are appropriate for work and pair well with a sportcoat or blazer, and which are not priced like a new suit.Fit: slightly tailored but without being tight. I\'ve got somewhat thick thighs for my waist size, which means I often try on pants that fit beautifully as long as I remain standing and then become uncomfortably tight around the quads the moment I sit down. These pants pass the all-important sitting test, which so many others fail.  The legs hang fairly straight below the knee with a medium break at the ankle when ordered in my usual length.

For reference, I am 6\'0"", 185lbs and typically wear 34W x 34L, which is what I ordered here.Color: I have two pair, one in navy blue and one in ""natural"" linen. The natural pair is a fairly light color, darker than off-white, but not by much, and certainly lighter than tan. Think unbleached paper cone coffee filter. The coloring has a little bit of natural variation. The navy pair, however, has an even and consistent color throughout that tends to mask the texture of the fabric unless seen up close, so the pants aren\'t obviously linen when seen from more than a few feet away.Care: Since these are dress pants, you won\'t want to go with the crumpled look of casual linen beach wear.

My son is over 6ft tall.  We jumped online and were able to find this pair of nice dress pants for him that we could get quickly.  We were taking a chance a bit not being able to try them on but IZOD is a good brand and we took the chance.  I know the style right now is to wear pants above the ankle however for these dress pants we wanted them to fit at ankle length.  They didn't disappoint and were perfect fit and looked really nice for a good price.  He was happy with them, too which my son can be picky about his clothes.  This was definitely a great purchase!"", 'The pants look great and they certainly are slim fitting. I wear a 29x32 and it’s real close to being too tight at the waist. This never happens. The length seems shorter so I will definitely hang dry them.', ""I usually buy the IZOD Men's Madison Slim Fit Pant (which are great) but found I needed slightly longer length of 31 waist x 34 length. As when I cross my legs sitting down I show too much of my ankles which sometimes causes business meetings to get a little off-topic. This Flat Front Slim version allows a 31x34, fits just as well on my waist but allows more length and just a slight more room in the leg. They are now my favourite pants for office work and go great with a business shirt or even a polo for the casual days.My waist is exactly 83cm (32.5 inches) and 88cm (34.5 inches) length from bottom of ankle to waist belt area.As I have used IZOD pants for a few years now, these are the positives and negatives:Positives:* Material is of a good thickness. Not too thin, not too heavy.* I have found I don't need to iron these.* Deep pockets* Comfortable, soft material* Only slim pants that I have found that look great on me. I don't look skinny in these.Negatives:* The material seriously attracts fluff. This seems to go away after a few washes. But before this time you will need the sticky roller every time you use them.* The material will start to fray at the bottom of leg where it rubs on my shoe after about 3-5 months (weekly washing). If not here, something else will start fraying like the belt holders. If this is a concern I recommend only washing these when it is necessary (and not simply every time you use them) to make the pants last longer.Year Later Update: still going strong on these pants and they are yet to fray.Since my original review, Amazon US don't ship to us poor Aussies any longer and our local site doesn't stock these. I really hope Amazon AU get it in soon before I need another pair.Out of sheer madness I walked into a local retailer, which was an experience in itself. Bought a pair of similar looking pants, best price I could find but still more expensive than my Amazon US order (go figure). They ended up being terrible quality and just didn't look good on me. No return allowed for change of mind. So now I use them for car oil change rags.So cheers to you lucky people who can access the awesome inventory of Amazon US and have a thought for us poor bastards down here who are, at the moment, being placed on strict rations.UPDATE Oct 2019:Unfortunately the cut has suddenly changed to a skinny style. The top waist is still the same cut but the lower half has changed where it now hugs your calf muscles and tapers in tight around your ankles. Shame, was a great fitting pair of trousers.""]"

I checked out Ralph Lauren and they had some cool waxed canvas cargo thing.  G-Star has all kinds of cool cargos as well.  As you can tell I'm not a hiker or outdoorsman.  I'm a Brooklynite in NYC.  I like cool clothes.  6ft2 I look good in my clothes.  Anyway, so I'm not satisfied with G-Star, Ralph Lauren, or any of the big brands that I normally buy.  Why?  Cos as expensive and cool looking as they are, they wear somewhat quick, especially around the crotch.  I'm tired of buying clothes all the time.So after a small search low and behold I run across this fine company Fjällräven and decided to get the Greenland Jeans.  Yeah I studied them online, checked out the fit, reviews, etc.  But I'm a different kind of guy then most people who buy them... my first thought is style.  Second durability.  Last cost.I got the Greenland Jeans and wow! They''re like Ralph Lauren, G-Star and anyone else, but just tough.  I love the fit.  And I actually wear them in more business casual situations, with a blazer and stuff.  Then I thought, what about these Vidda Pro trousers I was eyeing?Got 'em and haven't looked back.  These things are like a cross between cargo/chino, moto trousers, and outdoor toughguy trousers.  The fit is just perfect.  It's slightly baggier than the Greenland Jeans, but very proportional with all the pockets helping out.  The bonus is the adjustable bottom ankle cuff.  I where them a lot with cool loafers, slightly tapered in.  Then I can wear them with danner boots and the cuff all the way open.  And guys... the ladies LOVE THEM!!  Seriously the girls check 'em out and the guys are always wondering where these cool pants come from.So in a nutshell... just get the pants.  Very light weight and stylish to the height of being stylish.  I can tell that I'll have these and the Greenland Jeans for a super duper long time.  Boom!"", 'I did quite a bit of research before landing on these.....and so far I”m glad I did.  Bought them mainly as a hiking pant, at least for now, and while they have just arrived, they certainly seem to be a well made and well engineered pant.  I also spent quite a bit of time looking at these  reviews to make a call on size.  In sum, I am 6’5”, 215, with a 36/37 waist, and a 36 length in jeans.  I got the 54 long, and fit for both is nearly perfect.  I say nearly because ideally both would be just a hair smaller, but I am certainly fine with as is, and no plans on my part to return.  As these wear in, I may come back to update on what I experience for durability, which is the only reason right now I haven’t given 5 stars.', 'I\'m 6ft and got the long version but they are a bit too long, so bear that in mind. I think you\'ll need to be 6\'2"" for the long. Thankfully you can turn them up so not a bother for me.

Really robust material and breathable with waterproof bottom and knee panelling. Material is also slightly stretchy which makes for a lot more comfort over competitors who trade ruggedness for lack of stretch.Pockets positioned perfectly around any phage and harnesses I wear and very cleverly shifted forward around the thigh. A little touch which makes SUCH a big difference for ease of accessibility. There are plenty of pockets of varying sizes without any being too large that they’re cumbersome. Length is perfect - regular comes with extra length to come well over your boot and lace hooks are brass so won’t rust. Further, there is still diffident length to accommodate squatting without any pull.I am personally not a fan of waterproof trousers, I haven’t needed them and just get too hot in them. These trousers are Greenland Wax compatible so it’s nice to have the option of making them waterproof if needed, at the sacrifice of breathability. Rub it on, wash it off in a normal 40 degree wash. But in my experience thus far, they are sufficiently breathable to quickly dry off and don’t hold much water making them comfortable for very wet walks.Sizing runs small - I went for a 52 (36”) when I’m usually a 50 (34”)', 'Good quality but if you not have a chiseled physique might find issue fitting around waist, no stretch and not do long in all sizes.

The material itself is reminiscent of both winter and summer weight American BDU's. A little heavier than summer weights, and isn't rip stop material, but does have the feel of winter weights without being quite as heavy. Their a happy medium. They do wrinkle, just the right amount if that's the look that you like, but nothing a touch of a quick iron can't handle.As for their bagginess I think they are perfect in this arena as well. Not overly so that you can't rock some Chuck Taylor's or Van's with them, and not underly so that they look weird with Osiris or DC's. They also have the built in blousing straps if you want to wear them with jump/combat boots. However, I'v always found using external straps, or just tucking them in to be more comfortable, easy, and look better.I am overwhelmingly happy with these cargo pants. They met my wants and needs, and exceeded my expectations. Dilivery time was even much faster than was estimated, and customer satisfaction is important enough for them to send an email to follow up on my purchase. I think that for the price this is an excellent and awesome product. I will definitely suggest them to my friends and personally buy from them again."", ""I purchased these pants because the style was going to work for what I was doing. I washed them before wearing them and discovered that in the washer and dryer the crotch stitching had come undone.Inspecting it, it looks like the fabric folded when they were sewing it on the machine and so only part of that section was actually stitched. Inspecting the pants further I found a couple of other spots where the stitching was incomplete and seems were coming undone.If I had bought these for everyday wear I would have sent them back and immediately, however I bought them for a cosplay and was going to weather them anyway, so I simply restitched those spots by hand and made it part of the weathering of the pants to make them look more worn.They might be good otherwise if there were no stitching issues, they were comfortable. The fabric was easy to sew back, but if you buy them I would turn them inside out and check the seams for weak points or sewing errors. I found three places it looks like either the fabric folded so they didn't get the stitching right, or where it looks like the machine ran out of thread and they worker just decided to finish them up anyway,"", ""I really like these pants.  They are big, and baggy, but that's what I love about them.  The one thing that is kind of weird, is the length.  I mean, I am 6'1 and the legs completely cover my feet - and then go another 2 or 3 inches.  I don't care about the ankle ties, so I pulled them out and brought them over to my dry cleaner guy to get about 5 or 6 inches hemmed off the legs.  Now they are perfect.  So, if you are about 6'5, or 6'8 these are the perfect length.  If not, I hope your town has a decent tailor, or you are gonna be walking around with some bunched up pants at your ankles."", ""These pants are super comfortable. They're baggy and the people who have said they are kind of long are not wrong. They come with the longest waist drawstring I've ever seen on pants! I like them but biggest complaint is that they are not black/white/gray as they look in the picture. They are definitely brown."", 'These pants were so good I’ve stayed to the brand and style since 2013, I’ve found them to be very comfortable and hard wearing, great for working in, sitting around or even smart casual, until my last 2 purchases, I put the previous pair down to - well you’ve had so many your bound to get a hiccup, the last one though was just plain bad workmanship, buttons fell off, the tie cords have snapped off, even the material feels different.

I don't give them high marks for comfort. although I will add, you dont really feel it when you're wearing them. you don't actually feel the shorts roughing your skin up, so maybe it doesnt matter much. plus like I said, they are smooth, so they glide against your skin nicely enough. the stretch is fine. you have to be realistic with a cotton short. you're not gonna get a polyester stretch with traditional training shorts. but I can pretty easily lift my leg all the way up onto a sink top with no issue. obviously the best testing method. so they do stretch pretty well.Overall i'd give them 4 stars because they aren't bad and are good enough for the money.

The manufacturer\'s size chart stated that the 2X size I purchased would accommodate a 38 inch waist, but it actually it seems to be made for closer to a 42 inch waist (though waist can be pulled tighter with the included drawstring).  Since 42 inch waist is the more usual waist size associated with 2X, I went ahead and marked the fit ""as expected,"" even though I actually had expected the waist to be smaller.Manufacturer\'s size chart also states that this size 2X would accommodate 51 inch hips, and though my hips are nowhere near this big, I suspect the hip size statement is probably true.

Having no closure at the waist an no fly will have you pulling up the leg in a hurry.', 'Debunking the belt issue:First off, 1st or 2nd review of a couple hundred purchases on Amazon.  In short, I love these shorts and there have been some reviews that voiced a concern with the belt; however, they are somewhat misguided.  I\'m writing this review because they are by far my favorite shorts and really, really do not want them to ever be discontinued....For some reason, Columbia stitches the cardboard tag for the shorts through the belt of the shorts on the RH rear side.  A typical consumer, myself included, just rips off the tag, puts them on and goes about his business.  The problem is that the two threaded stitched loops that were used to attach the tag typically DO NOT come off when that cardboard tag is ripped off - they stay there attached through the belt.  As a result, the belt is attached to the rear of the shorts and will not slide to adjust when tightened.  A simple solution is to use a pair of scissors to cut those stitched loops off.  At that point the belt is fully adjustable and actually works really well.  AGAIN, JUST CUT OFF THE STITCHED THREAD LOOPS THAT GO THROUGH THE BELT USED TO ATTACH THE TAG.I actually almost threw a pair away for this reason, but was going to cut out the belt for other uses and came across the stitching.  I wish they would note this, or even better, not stitch through the belt, but they\'ve been doing this for years.  COLUMBIA, DO YOU READ THESE???As mentioned before, these are by far my favorite shorts and I have at least 8 pairs.  I wear the shorter 9"" ones for wade fishing or jet skiing.  I prefer the 11"" ones for hiking, general around the house duties or going out.  They are a very comfortable nylon, are cool, very fast drying and breathe extremely well in hot weather.  I live in Ohio, but spend a lot of time in SW Florida and these are comfortable in both locales.  I\'m 5\'-10"" and about 170#, well.. 180#, and the mediums sit well and don\'t have to be hiked up all the time like other shorts. The 11"" hits the middle of my knee and the 9"" hits a hair above the kneecap. There is a mesh brief inside that is not too tight or to short, so undies are not needed to be worn.  They don\'t fade, I have had none fail in stitching, they don\'t pill, hold up to 100\'s of washings, are stain resistant - seriously they are darn near perfect.  I honestly can find no fault with these shorts other than the issue with the tag stitching and that\'s easily remedied.There\'s a zippered side pocket for phone or wallet and two front pockets.  None in the rear.I\'m surprised that nobody else pointed this out, but it is not really obvious.I really don\'t write reviews, but I\'d love to hear your feedback on this one if that\'s how it works.-JK', 'Seem to be well made and the belt holds up the shorts when the pockets are full of stuff unlike drawstring shorts', ""The built-in belt doesn't work well.

Phone and wallet were safe in my pockets, and water stayed off after going on some rides with water feature. They are very comfortable for all day walking as well', 'I bought these shots for my Dad, who underwent pelvic surgery, and was advised to wear pants with a stretchy waist and a relaxed fit around the crotch during his recovery. # 1. Loosening the included inelastic belt, the waist of the delivered shorts was indeed stretchy (elongating nearly 3"" if stretched by hand), and the fabric itself stretched four ways (though not as much as shown in one of the seller images). These are the only positive things about the shorts, which otherwise were a remarkable disappointment. # 2. The quality control is dismal -- the inseam of one leg appeared to be at least 1/2"" shorter than the inseam of the other leg when wearing the shorts. A more objective demonstration is shown in one of my attached figures, in which both legs were placed flat on a ruler along their stitched inseam edge (which can be seen descending from the crotch in the second figure from the top of this webpage); the superimposed inseams were secured with clips at the starting midline point on the crotch and at the hem of the pants; the arrow on the inset indicates the difference between legs. # 3. The cut fails to provide a relaxed fit in the crotch region, which resulted in obvious tension on the midline stitching and binding. # 4. The wall of the rear pockets facing the skin are not made of the same fabric as the rest of the shorts, but of mesh; see my other figure. This is not described in this webpage. While it might help in drying the shorts after wading in waist-deep water, it reduces confidence on how secure a wallet would be placed in one such pocket, whose bottom is not made by folding a piece of a fabric but by stitching together two pieces of different fabrics with quite different attaching surfaces. # 5. The front zippered pockets are a bit shallow, and their zippers not that responsive; they were not easy to unzip when standing up, and nearly impossible to unzip when sitting down. The gusseted cargo pockets have an irregular pentagonal shape; they are slanted, so the height varies from ~7.5"" at the pocket\'s outer vertical edge to ~5.5"" at the inner edge, and the pocket\'s opening is ~7"". They are not on the side but the front of the thigh, making the shorts less comfortable when carrying a smart phone with a  case in one of these pockets. # 6. There is an absolute disconnect between the three inseam claims present in this webpage at the time of this writing : [i] the clickable Size Chart at top says in its ""US Stretch Shorts"" table (the only one where the shorts sizes match the waist sizes) the inseam varies between 8.5"" and 9.5"" independent of the size; [ii] the top figure of the Product Description section, next to the image of a hike, says the inseam is 11""; [iii] towards the bottom of this section, also next to the same image of the same hiker, a Size Chart says inseam length varies between 9.5"" and 13"" depending on the size. # 7. The latter size chart also shows that waist, hip, and inseam measurements for any given size can vary by up to 1"".  The implicit assumption that such a variability in the inseams is only among different shorts of the same size, and not between the legs of the same shorts, is --as described above--  false.  There are just too many inexactitudes associated with these shorts made in China.  They were returned immediately._', 'I bought four size medium of these shorts for my husband.

I wish they had two then I wouldn\'t notice but... it seems to be on the wrong side for this rightie. :)Being right handed, I was taught when given my first billfold to keep it in my left rear pocket. And for a right handed gentleman, that has always seemed the logical placement. I don\'t need to use my dominate hand to reach back and get my billfold. So I use my left to retrieve, and my dominate right hand to do the ""delicate"" work that required the coordination. (Flipping through notes, removing card, etc.)Not a huge deal but I\'ll make sure to note rear pocket arrangement next pair of shorts I purchase. I will however take a star off for their cheaping out and only providing one rear pocket. Keeping my billfold on the right means reaching back with my right hand, retrieving it, placing it in my left hand, and doing the deed with my right. One extra step. I suspect many gentlemen do it that way but being a gentleman myself, I don\'t notice things like that. :)So... I\'ll keep it in the left front, more secure anyway I reckon..']"

The XL I received has a waist band that is too small (more like a large) and does not match the fit of the XL shorts.', ""I'm giving these 4 stars because of the quality vs price. I've been wearing Nike and Under Armor (UA) compression shorts, the same 10 pairs or so as underwear for years (some size medium, some large). Recently, I bought some new UA shorts size LG, and the waist band feels like it is trying to cut off the circulation to my legs. I've put on a little weight... But not THAT much (6ft 220lbs, size 36 waist). So I ordered a pair of the Nike's size LG, they kept the boys a little too snug and the thighs were much tighter than the UA (I have larger than average thighs so I'm used to that with most clothes I buy), but the waist band was a tiny bit better, but still painful after a while. So then I found these champion shorts for more than half the price, so I gave them shot. They feel just as quality, but the waist band was just as tight as the Nike's, but the thighs felt better. I decided to order a pair of the XL just to see if I liked them more... The shorts feel a bit looser, but not by much, I was hoping the waist band would be much looser (now beginning to kill my self confidence after finding the XL still feels too small lol). Today I gave in, swallowed my pride and ordered an XXL hoping that these will finally be the shorts that fit me. Maybe I just prefer them looser than most people, but the LG and XL would leave harsh red rings around my waist after wearing them all day, and I've never had these problems until I started ordering all these new ones... Again, I'm not in the best shape, but I'm not in terrible shape, so I don't see why I would have to order an XXL for someone my size. Anyways, if I were you, I would order 1 to 2 sizes larger than you think you need.Maybe someone here can correct me. Maybe a size 36 waist should be buying an XL or XXL? I don't mind them tight, but not so tight where they leave painful rings around my waist. And I realize they stretch out over time... Which is probably why I could wear a medium with no problem for years. Most days I resort back to wearing one of my pairs that are a few years old just to not deal with such a tight waist band.

Of course, the time of their lives was because of their high quality Calvin Klein boxer briefs and Under Armor compression shorts.  2 years had gone by living with the agony and distress of only wearing boxers. I was 15, and thought I should be hitting the weight room soon. I Before I got to the gym my first day, I expected to see others that looked just like me working out. When I got there, my heart deflated. Others were wearing similar athletic shorts, and a cutoff or short sleeve shirt. But I could tell that wasn\'t it. Just observing the way they walked, they way they talked, how they interacted with others, I could tell without a second thought that each and every one of them were wearing compression shorts. I, of course, was the only one wearing boxers. Things just weren\'t working out in my teen years.  I was 16, and starting to take more control of the decisions I made in life. I had just recently entered my payment method onto my Amazon account, and was buying things such as biographies for history class, accessories for my camera, and other small things. I was at a friends house playing ultimate frisbee. We decided that it would be shirts vs. skins, and my team was skins. I removed my shirt, and let the beautiful beams of sunlight run through my skin. It was a great game of frisbee, until I looked down to see my boxers showing from under my ""The Come Sail Aways"" shorts by Chubbies.

I scrolled through the results clicked on the \'Champion Men\'s Powerflex Compression Short\', and checked out.  The old expression, ""No guts, no glory"", may seem like an old folk song to some, but when you witness something that calls upon a substantial amount of bravery, the four words have an exceeding depth of meaning.

No. But they are very close, like 90% of what Lulus are, and they are much cheaper. These are less than half the price of on-sale Lululemon.The Pros: these are hard wearing and the fabric and stitching did not degrade at all over almost a hundred runs per pair, with a heavy duty wash afterwards. The printed interior label eventually washes out, if we are being nit picky. If you care about that there is something wrong with you. There are 2 pockets: a phone pocket and a key/ID pocket. They are well sized. The compression liner is not too tight and it keeps its compression. They are a great cut for running with the shorter inseam.The Cons: I threw one of the three pairs away today because the zipper broke. The zipper on the rear pocket isn’t great. However, it’s about on par with what Lululemon, Enlightened Equipment, and Jottnar use. Also, if you are comparing these to Lulu, Brooks, or Nike, the fabric is slightly more heavy and coarse. Just slightly.

All pairs we ordered fit the same so size is consistentCOLORS: let me just say, it is SO HARD to find normal colored clothing! these shorts come in basic colors that will go with whatever.LENGTH: the reason my boyfriend loves these is due to the length. they do not go below the knee (like most basketball shorts do nowadays) but they are not high to where they look like those short running shorts. If you are an average height man or shorter, then these are the perfect shorts for you. If you are EXTREMELY TALL i would probably get a different pair.USE: material is very breathable and not clingy, does not show off outline of the man's package if he is not wearing underwear (yes some shorts do this). banding is good to where the shorts stay up during extreme running, jumping, exercise.STITCHING: i put this on all my clothes reviews as this is a big issue for me. the threading is done well so the stitching will not come undone after extreme use or in the wash.PRICE: wayyyy cheaper than other shorts we have looked atSHIPPING: we got them in in 3 days when the shipping speed said 3-5 business days.Overall an amazing product for the male athlete in your family and it is a reasonable price so you can get multiples. :)"", 'My go-to shorts for lounging around the house.

But by golly are the pockets just slightly too aerodynamic that trying to run with anything heavier than a credit card results in a most uncomfortable jostling, not to mention the added anxiety that your belongings could fall out at any moment (although this has yet to happen, which, like a jump-scare in a David Lynch film, ironically causes more anxiety because you're in a constant state of anticipation for something that may never come.)

My one issue is that there are no secure pockets for small items. The best workout shorts will have a pocket with a zippier or some sort of fastener to keep loose items from falling out.
